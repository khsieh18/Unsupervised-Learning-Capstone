    "For this project you'll dig into a large amount of text and apply most of what you've covered in this unit and in the course so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, pick a set of texts. This can be either a series of novels, chapters, or articles. Anything you'd like. It just has to have multiple entries of varying characteristics. At least 100 should be good. There should also be at least 10 different authors, but try to keep the texts related (either all on the same topic of from the same branch of literature - something to make classification a bit more difficult than obviously different subjects).\n",
    "\n",
    "This capstone can be an extension of your NLP challenge if you wish to use the same corpus. If you found problems with that data set that limited your analysis, however, it may be worth using what you learned to choose a new corpus. Reserve 25% of your corpus as a test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first technique is to create a series of clusters. Try several techniques and pick the one you think best represents your data. Make sure there is a narrative and reasoning around why you have chosen the given clusters. Are authors consistently grouped into the same cluster?\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, perform some unsupervised feature generation and selection using the techniques covered in this unit and elsewhere in the course. Using those features then build models to attempt to classify your texts by author. Try different permutations of unsupervised and supervised techniques to see which combinations have the best performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly return to your holdout group. Does your clustering on those members perform as you'd expect? Have your clusters remained stable or changed dramatically? What about your model? Is it's performance consistent?\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is a divergence in the relative stability of your model and your clusters, delve into why.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your end result should be a write up of how clustering and modeling compare for classifying your texts. What are the advantages of each? Why would you want to use one over the other? Approximately 3-5 pages is a good length for your write up, and remember to include visuals to help tell your story!"

said the woman   i cant go with you now        after a time she fell down on her knees. she pressed them against    her face     she laid her hand upon the knob of the church door      it is he   whispered the priest;  his sorrow was greater than mine      absolvo te     the cry for bread     i  the baby   a little child shall lead them      i  the baby   the heavy perfume of rare blossoms  the wild strains of mad music  the patter of flying feet  the murmur of speech  the ring of laughter  filled the great hall. now and again a pair of dancers  peculiarly graceful and particularly daring  held the center of the floor for a moment while the room rang with applause.  into alcoves  screened and flower-decked  couples wandered. in the dancing-space hands were clasped  bosoms rose and fell  hearts throbbed  pulses beat  and moving bodies kept time to rhythmic sound.  suddenly the music stopped  the conversation ceased  the laughter died away. almost  as it were  poised in the air  the dancers stood amazed. one looked to another in surprise. something stole throughout the room which was neither music  nor lights  nor fragrance  but which was life a presence!   do you see that child   asked the wildest of the dancers of her escort.  there   she pointed.  he looks like a very little boy.    i see nothing   said the man  who still held her in the clasp of his arm.   he is strangely dressed  although i see him indistinctly  vaguely   whispered the woman.  he wears a long white robe and there is a kind of light about his face. see  he is looking at us.    i see nothing   repeated the man in low tones.  the heat  the light  the music  have disturbed you; let me get you     i want nothing   interposed the woman  waving the man aside and drawing away from his arm.  dont you see him  there    she made a step toward the center of the room. she stopped  put her hand to her head.   why  he is gone   she exclaimed.   good   said the man  while at that instant the room suddenly rang with cries   go on with the music  the dance is not half over.  he extended his arm to the woman again.  our dance is not finished.    yes  it is   she said as the flying feet once more twinkled across the polished floor  as everybody took a long breath and a new start apparently unconscious of the pause.   it is over for me. what i saw!    what did you see     i dont know  but im going back home to my child. good-night.                                             yes  the music had stopped suddenly. the man in the farthest alcove turned to his companion. they were hidden by a group of palms.   i wonder why   queried the woman. she was deathly pale. her eyes were dark with fear  yet alight with passionate determination.   when it begins   said the man tenderly   we will slip away. my car is outside. everything is ready.    that is my husband over there   said the woman.   yes   said the man   he wont trouble you any more.    that woman with him is leaving him   she said.  i wonder why.  she turned suddenly with a great start.  there is somebody here   she whispered  staring into the back of the alcove.   nonsense   said the man  throwing a glance around the recess.  theres nobody here but you and   we are alone together  as we shall be hereafter  when we have taken the step.    but that child   whispered the woman   with his strange vesture and his wonderful face. his eyes look at me so.    there is no child there  my dear   urged the man;  you are overwrought  excited  nervous. the music starts. let us go.   he stretched out his hand to the woman  but as he came nearer she shrank back with her own hand on her heart.   oh   she said faintly   hes gone.    of course hes gone   he answered soothingly.  now is our time to get away. let me     no  no   said the woman.  i cant go with you now. it wouldnt be right.    but you knew that before   pleaded the man.  besides     yes  but i cant do it. he was there! his eyes spoke i dont touch me   she said;  im going back to my husband. dont follow.      ii  the child      suffer the little children to come unto me      ii  the child   the employees had all gone home  carrying with them christmas checks and hearty greetings from the great man whose beck and nod they followed. he sat in his private office absolutely alone. he had some serious matters to consider and did not want any interruptions. his balance-sheet for the year had been made up according to the custom of the firm before christmas instead of on new years day. he examined it again. it showed tremendous profit. the mills were turning out quantities of material  the demand for which was greater and the cost of production less than ever before.   i tell you   said the man to himself   it was a master-stroke to displace the men with children in the mills. they have reduced the cost by four fifths. war has made the prices go up. this is not wealth  it is riches beyond calculation.   he picked up a letter  read it over. it was a proposal from the superintendent to clear more land  to build more buildings  to install more machines  to employ more children and increase the profits greatly.   ill do it   said the man.  we can crush opposition absolutely. ill control the markets of the world. ill build a fortune upon this foundation so great that no one can comprehend it.   he stopped  leaned back in his chair  lifted his eyes up toward the ceiling of the room and saw beyond it the kingdoms of this world and the means unlimited to make him lord and master. he gave no thought to the foundations  only to the structure erected by his fancy. how long he indulged in dreams he scarcely realized  but presently he put his hands on the arms of the chair and started to rise  saying    ill telegraph the superintendent to go ahead.   he had scarcely formulated the words when right in front of him  seated on his desk  he saw a young lad regarding him intently. he stopped  petrified  in the position he had assumed.   how did you get in  what are you doing here   he asked. there was no answer.  come   said the man  shrinking back.  i cant imagine how you got in here. if my people had not all gone i should hold them to strict account. as it is  you    the room was suddenly filled with people. they came crowding through the walls from every side and pressed close to him. such people he had never seen  wan  worn  stunted  pinched  starved  joyless. they were all children  meagerly clothed  badly nourished  ill developed. they were quite silent. they did not cry. they did not protest. they did not argue. they did not plead. they did not laugh. they just looked at him. they made no sound of any sort. he had children of his own and he had known many children. he had never known so many gathered together without a smile or a laugh.  his eye wandered around the room. they were very close to him and yet they did not touch him. he turned to the desk where the lad had sat  but he was no longer there and yet he well remembered his face. he knew exactly how he looked. he turned to the nearest child and in some strange way  although the poor  wretched face had not changed  his look suggested the lad who had been his first visitor. he turned to another and another. they all looked back at him in the same way with the same eyes.  he threw his head up again and saw the castle of success of which he had dreamed. he looked down again. this was the foundation. slowly his hand went to the desk. the little crowding figures drew back to give him freedom of movement as he stretched his hand out for a telegraph-blank. he drew it to him. he seized a pen and wrote rapidly    build no more mills  take the children out of those already in operation  put men in their places. we will be content with less profit in the future.   he read over the telegram. the telephone was close at hand. he called up the telegraph-office  dictated it and directed it to be sent immediately. he had been so engrossed in this task that he had noticed nothing else. now he looked up. the room was still filled with children  but they were all laughing. it was a soundless laugh  and yet he heard it. and then the room was empty save for the child he had seen first and vaguely. he had just time to catch a smile from his lips and then he  too  was gone as silently and as strangely as he had appeared.  was it a dream  no  there was the telegram in his hand! had he sent it  again he called up the office on the telephone.   did you get a message from me just a minute ago     yes  do you want to recall it    the man thought a second.   no   he said quietly was it to himself or to his vanished visitors   let it go. merry christmas.      iii  the friend      inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these  my brethren      iii  the friend    is the story of the christ child true  mommy   quivered one little  thin voice.   yes  they told us it was over at the mission sunday-school   said the littlest child.   i dont believe it   answered the mother.  god aint never done much for me.    its christmas eve  aint it   asked the boy  climbing up on the thin knees of the threadbare woman and nestling his thin face against a thinner breast which the rags scarcely covered decently.   yes  its christmas eve.    and thats the day he came  aint it   urged the oldest girl.   they say so.    dont you believe it  mommy     i used to believe it when i was a girl. i believed it before your father died  but now     dont you believe it now   repeated the first child.   how can i believe it  youre old enough to understand. thats the last scuttle of coal we got. we ate the last bit of bread for supper to-night.    they say   put in the little boy   that if you hang up your stockings  santa clausll fill em  cause of the christ child.    dont you believe it  sonny   said the mother desperately.   im going to hang up mine and see   said the littlest girl.   hes got too many other children to look after   said the woman   to care for the likes of us  im afraid  and     but my sunday-school teacher said he came to poor people special. he was awful poor himself. why  he was born in a stable. thats awful poor  aint it   asked the boy.   when i was a girl   answered the mother   i lived on a farm and we had a stable there that was a palace to this hole we live in now. no  youd better not hang up your stockings  none of you.    and you dont believe in him  mommy     no. what would be the use if you hung em up and didnt find anything in em in the morning     itd be awful  but i believe in him   said the littlest girl.  i dont think god has forgot us  really. im going to try.    i tell you taint no use.    oh  yes  it is.    im sure it aint. but have it your own way   said the woman.  if someone would fill your stockings with milk and bread and     i want a turkey   said the oldest girl.   and cranberry sauce   added the boy.   i want a doll-baby in mine   said the littlest girl.  the mother hid her face and groaned aloud.   you aint sick  are you  mommy     i guess so. come  youd better say your prayers and go to bed. we dont have to keep the fire going so hard when youre all covered up.   it did not take long for the three little youngsters to divest themselves of the rags of clothing they wore. they slept in what passed for their underclothes  so there was no donning of white gowns for the night.   here are our stockings  mommy   said the oldest  handing three ragged  almost footless  black stockings to the woman.   its no use  i tell you. i cant do it.    it wont do any harm  mommy   urged the girl.   do you believe in it  too   asked the mother  and the girl shook her head.  you wont be disappointed in the morning if theres nothing in em     no  i suppose it will be because santa claus was too busy.   with nervous fingers the woman hung the three stockings near the window. she was hungry  she was cold  she was broken  she was a mother. she could scarcely keep from crying.   maybe youll be glad you did it   said the littlest girl drowsily.   aint you comin to bed  too  mommy   asked the oldest  beneath the covers over the mattress on the floor.   in a little while.    and you wont forget to say your prayers     i aint said em for months  ever since your father was killed  and we got so poor.    but youll say em to-night cause its christmas eve     yes  to-night   said the mother;  now you go to sleep.    are you waitin for him to come  mommy   asked the littlest girl  who was very sleepy.   yes   said the mother.  presently  as she sat in the dark  having turned out the light  the deep breathing of the children told her they were asleep. she rose quietly  stepped to the window  and stood looking at the three shapeless  tattered stockings. she was high up in the tenement and the moonlight came softly over the house roofs of the city into the bare  cold  cheerless room. she stared at the stockings and tears streamed down her wasted cheeks. she had hung them low at the suggestion of the littlest girl so the children could easily get at them in the morning.     after a time she fell down on her knees. she pressed them against her face. she did not say anything. she could scarcely think anything. she just knelt there until something gently drew her head around. she dropped the stockings. she put her right hand on the window-ledge to steady herself and looked backward.  no sound save the breathing of the children and her own stifled sobs had broken the silence; the door was shut  but a man was there  a man of strange vesture seen dimly in the moons radiance  yet there was a kind of light about his face. she could see his features. they were those of a man in middle years. they were lined with care. he had seen life on its seamy side. the woman felt that he had known poverty and loneliness. she stared up at him.   i didnt believe   she whispered;  it cannot be. i thought we were forgotten.   the man slowly raised his hand. the moonlight struck fair upon it. she saw that it was calloused  the hand of a man who toiled. it was extended over her head. there was no bodily touch  but her head bent low down until she rested it upon her hands upon the floor. when she looked up  the room was empty. there was no sound save the breathing of the children and the throb of her own heart which beat wildly in the fearful hollow of her ear.  she heard a sound of strange footsteps outside the door. there was a crackle as of paper  the soft sound of things laid upon the floor  a gentle rapping on the panels  a light laugh  a rustle of draperies  footsteps moving away. as in a dream she got to her feet  she knew not how. she opened the door.  the hall was dimly illuminated. her feet struck a little heap of joy-bringing parcels. she leaned back against the door-jamb  her hand to her heart  trembling. what could it mean   a tiny voice broke the silence. it was the littlest girl turning over in her sleep  murmuring incoherently and then clearly    if you only believe  thats enough; if you only believe.      iv  the workman   is not this the carpenter       iv  the workman   in the mean squalid room back of the saloon half a score of men were assembled. they were all young in years  in other things not youthful. some of them lounged against the wall. some sat at tables. all were drinking. the air was foul with smoke and reeked with the odor of vile liquor.   weve got two jobs on hand to-night   said the leader of the gang.  theres a crib to be cracked an a guy to be croaked. red  you an gypsie an the gunney will crack the crib. its dead easy. only an old man an his wife. the servants are out except one an hes fixed. ill give you the layout presently. the other jobs harder. kid  ill put you in charge  an as its got to be done early to-night ill give you the orders now. hell be at the montmorency at ten oclock. someone will call him out to the street.    who     never mind who. youll be there in the car.    whose car     never mind whose. whyre you askin so many questions  itll take you an the four to the montmorency at ten oclock. when he comes out every one of you let go  the whole bunch  understand. if they dont find five bullets in him therell be trouble to-morrow.    what do we get out of it     a hundred apiece fer you an a hundred an fifty fer me fer engineerin the job. christmas money! you get me     of course. howll we know who weve got to shoot     ill be there myself on the sidewalk. ill point him out to you.

in half an hour.    now  gimme my orders   said red.  the gang leader scribbled something on a bit of paper.   you go to that number with these two guys between midnight an two in the mornin. youll find a back winder open. heres the combination of the safe. the silverll be in that.    jewels     in a wall cabinet upstairs. itll be unlocked.    an if they make any noise     croak em  of course.

men   he added  first pouring himself a liberal glassful   an heres to bringin it off easy.   with deep relish the toast was drunk by all save red and the kid. red set his glass down on the table. the kid dropped his to the floor.   theres somebody else in the room   whispered red.   yes  yonder by the door   said the kid.  you cn jest see him.    dont be a fool   said the gang leader.  theres nobody here but us.    hes wearin strange clothes   said red.   he looks like a carpenter by his kit o tools   said the kid.   here  pull yourselves together  men   said the gang leader;  youre dippy  theres nobody here. wheres your nerve    but red made no move to obey. he thrust his glass from him and rose and leaned over the table staring. the other men shrank back glancing at the two figures  for the kid had also dashed the proffered glass aside.   i see him   he said   hes lookin at me  hes lookin through me.   in his excitement he took a step forward and the table went over with a crash. the two men passed their hands over their eyes in bewilderment.   why  there aint nobody here   said the kid.   but i seen him i tell you   persisted red.   and so did      well  hes gone  whoever he was  accordin to your own showin   said the gang leader contemptuously.  now brace up. take your liquor. get a move on youse.    not me   exclaimed red suddenly.   nor me   said the kid.   what dye mean     i wont do it.    neither will     both men moved to the door. the gang leader sprang to intercept them  his arms upraised  his hands clenched.   lemme pass   said red.   are you goin to give us away     no   answered red.  but you dont rob no house  an you dont kill no man to-night.    you all know what that means   cried the leader.  here you men grab em.   but the rest of the gang hung back.   mebbe they did see somethin   said one.   you cowardly dogs   cried the leader.   we wont mention no names to nobody   said the kid   but you cant pull them jobs off. well jest warn em.    you swore youd be true to the gang  that youd obey orders an follow directions.    we wont give ye away but im goin to quit the gang an go to work   said red.   me too   said the kid.   work! hell!  exclaimed the gang leader  but they shoved him out of the way and went out of the door.     v  comforter      neither do i condemn thee      v  the comforter   she was a daughter of shame. even inexperience could see that as she wandered up and down the streets of the town  desperate  impelled to go on by a force too strong for her to resist. she trod the pavement  yet loathed the necessity and hated herself for her compliance. she had only to look forward to the jail or the hospital; yet there was always the river. had it come to that  was there nothing else   she lifted her eyes from the stone walk as hard as the heart of the world  and found herself opposite a brightly lighted building. she leaned against the door. from within came the sound of music  the strains of a hymn  words of prayer. the light streamed about her face from the stained window. this was a church of god. stained window  stained woman  confronting each other in the night!  there was no god for her. there might have been once  but she had committed the unpardonable sin against society and society was god. there was no place for her anywhere  save the jail or the hospital or the river. that last was the best. the street was deserted. she had thought it not a good place in which to ply her trade! she made a step forward and stopped.  in her pathway stood a figure seen dimly in the darkness. it stood in the shadow beyond the broad light from the painted window. there was something strangely familiar about it. she glanced up at that window. had the figure there stepped down and embodied itself vaguely on the walk before her      what was this strange figure  who was he  as she stared  the outline drew nearer. a man vested in long white draperies confronted her. he was bareheaded and appeared insensible to the cold in which she shivered. she put out her hand and something folded it back upon her breast. she opened her lips and something sealed them.  as she watched  the figure slowly moved. it bent forward and went slowly down on its knees on the sidewalk. the white hand began to trace strange  mysterious  unknown  incomprehensible characters upon the pavement. she watched with bated breath  some memory of another sinful woman of whom she had heard in childhood coming back to her prostrate mind. yes  and there behind the figure stood others  hateful and hating  very violent  passionate men. she stared from the handwriting in the dust to these others and they faded away. she was alone with the kneeling figure and  as she looked  it too vanished in the chill air.  she bent over the pavement. there was nothing there  yet she had received a message. after a last glance she turned away  new courage  new life  new hope in her heart.  she mounted the steps  she laid her hand upon the knob of the church door  she turned it and went bravely within.     vi  the burden bearer   he  bearing his cross  went forth      vi  the burden bearer   the sound of the running feet of the man smashing through the burned stubble ceased abruptly. he stopped at the threshold of the door. no friendly bark of dog welcomed him. from the barn there came no gentle lowing of cattle  no homely clucking of chickens. like the house the byre too had been ruined  gutted with flame.  the soldier whose march had brought him back to his own village that night stood in the entrance of what had been his home and stared at the smoking walls  the charred roof gaping to the sky  the empty casements. the enemy had been there. he whispered his young wifes name  he called softly to the baby  as if they might be sleeping somewhere within the devastated house. he listened for a reply but none came. perhaps he would have been thankful even for a groan or a cry of agony  anything that meant life. but all was silence within  without.  yonder on the winding road at the foot of the hill he could hear the trampling of men  the groaning of wheels  the clank of iron cavalrymen  the jingling of bits and swords  sharp words of command. the army was advancing. he could delay no longer. he must get back to his place in the ranks. summoning his courage he crossed the threshold and stepped into the vacant emptiness of the house. everything was gone but the four stone walls. there were unrecognizable heaps of ashes here and there. he bent over them fearfully in the twilight wondering whether the shapeless  formless masses were   something caught his eye. the one thing intact apparently. he stooped over it. it was the babys shoe white  it had been originally. he remembered it. now it was stained with blood. that was all that was left a little babys shoe  blood spotted. he pressed it to his heart and groaned aloud. a spasm of mortal anguish shook his frame. he lifted his clenched hand toward the sky overshadowing the roofless walls.  now he suddenly became aware that he was not alone. there was someone else in the room. he saw vaguely  indistinctly  a figure strangely clad  staggering on with bended back as if under some crushing load. he stared in the twilight striving to concentrate his faculties. the figure passed by. on its back was a shadowy something beams of wood roughly crossed  he decided. it raised its head and looked at him. the face was somehow lighter than the rest.  the mans arm fell. the room was empty after all. he stared at the little shoe. was it somewhere well with the child  with its mother  unbuttoning his tunic he thrust the little shoe within  over his heart. he straightened up. away off on the road a bugle call rang out above the tumult. he turned away  seized his rifle  shouldered it  stepped rapidly toward his regiment and his duty.     vii  the thorn crowned   the soldiers platted a crown of thorns and put it on his head      vii  the thorn crowned   it was ghastly cold in the ruined church. it had been warm enough there during the day  but the fire that had gutted it had died like the young acolyte  like the aged sacristan  the venerable mother  the sweet young novice  the women who had sought shelter there in vain. neither the dignity of age nor the sweetness of maidenhood nor the innocence of youth nor the sanctity of profession had availed.  the old priest was glad they were dead. life after what they had suffered had been unthinkable. he thanked god for that oblivion. he wished that he  too  might die in that violated shrine where he had peacefully ministered for so long a time. they had taken the flock  the shepherd must follow. he should have led.  he had fought  oh  he had played the man for the honor of the poor lambs committed to him. had he done right  should he not have stood dumb before the shearers  they had shot him and stabbed him and beaten him into insensibility. the last thing he had heard was the shriek of one woman  the piteous appeal of another. they thought he was dead  but he was living. why had he not died   how could god be so cruel  this was war. this ruined sanctuary  these broken men and women who had sought only to serve him! was there a god indeed  faith  hope  what were they  assurance  trust  words  words! ah  how he suffered.     it was bitter cold and yet he burned with fever. the tremors of pain so exquisite that they might almost be counted pleasure shot through his ruined  torn  broken figure  yet he recked little of these. it was the shame  the shame. he had been zealous for the lord of hosts. there was no god. men were not made in any image save that of hell. he could not move hand or foot  but he could see. he could speak. he could curse god and die.  as his lips framed that anathema he saw vaguely the figure of a stranger; a slender  wasted body  dark stains upon it in the moonlight. it wore some kind of curious headgear. the man stared. the light was reflected from the sharp points of long thorns. a cloth was fastened about the loins. the figure stood very straight in the desecrated holy of holies. a light seemed to come from its face. its eyes looked at the man with great pity. slowly the figure raised its arms. slowly the arms extended themselves; there were blood-stains in the palms of the hands.   it is he   whispered the priest.  his sorrow was greater than mine. lord  i believe.   he knew nothing more save that a great peace had suddenly stolen around him.     viii  the broken hearted      one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side      viii  the broken hearted    ill get that man if i die for it   said the soldier.  hes found the one position in the lines from which he can fire into our trenches.    its easier said than done   remarked his comrade   and the minute you cross that spot you come within his range. hell put a bullet through you before you can level a rifle or press a trigger.    ill not go that way   said the man.   what is your plan     you know that salient yonder on the right  im going out of the trench there.    when     now. ill wrap myself in white. that little run of coppice will cover me until i get within a few feet of him  then ill have to chance it.    wish i could help you  old man. id like to get that man. hes shot six of the best fellows in the company and     you can help me by making a diversion to attract his attention. keep him looking at that alley.   a few moments later the soldier shrouded in white crept out of the trench and noiselessly rolled down the slope to the bushes. the snow was deep on the ground. there was no touch of color about the soldier. he even thrust his rifle under the linen in which he had wrapped himself. outside the shelter of the trenches the wind blew with terrific force. it was terribly cold. he had discarded his overcoat for freedom of motion. only his indomitable resolution kept him alive. he locked his jaws together to keep his teeth from chattering. the ice-covered snow under his bare hands almost blistered the flesh as he crept along.  he intended to use the bayonet. if he shot the man he was stalking alarm would be given and he would be riddled with bullets before he got back. he was willing to give a life for a life if it were necessary  but he was reluctant to do so if it could be avoided. cold steel would be better. cold steel! he smiled grimly. it would need some hot blood to take the chill off the bayonet at the end of his rifle.  slowly  almost holding his breath lest he be noticed  he edged his way along. he had plenty of time for thought. this was not so easy a job as he had fancied  not the physical part  but the mental strain. he could shoot a man who was shooting at him  he could batter a man over the head who was trying to do the same to him  but this stalking a man in cold blood was different somehow. cold blood! he laughed soundlessly at his recurrent fancy. he went a little more slowly. finally he stopped to consider.  from the nook ahead of him in which the enemy had ensconced himself came a sudden rapid rattle of rifle-shots. his friend back in the trench was doing his part. the man was awake on the alert. it would be something of a fair fight  he thought with some little satisfaction. he surveyed the intervening space beyond the coppice. the men in the trenches on both sides would be awake  too. it would take him a few seconds to cross that space and get at the man he was stalking. could they shoot him before that  there was some shelter where the enemy was. if the stalker could get to that spot he would be protected for a moment from fire from the enemys trench.  it would take him a second or two to cross that space. in a second or two what might happen  well  he would have to risk that. at the very end of the coppice he gathered himself together and rose slowly to a crouching position. another rain of shots came from the nook; the mans rifle would be empty  he must give him no chance to reload. now it would be a fair fight with the bayonet.  he threw aside the white draperies that impeded his legs and in half a dozen bounds the two men were face to face.  no shot had been fired. yes  the magazine of the mans rifle was empty. he heard the crunch of his enemys feet on the snow. he rose to his feet  his bayoneted rifle extended. the two barrels struck with terrific force. the men swayed  drew back for another thrust  and they were suddenly aware of a mist-like figure between them  a figure draped in white  lightly  diaphanously.  they stood arrested  guns drawn back  and stared. the figure slowly extended its arm  carrying drapery with it. a mans breast was bared. there  over the heart  was a great gaping wound  fresh  as if a broad  heavy blade had pierced it.  there was a clatter on the ice as a gun dropped and another clatter as a similar weapon struck the stone opposite. the two men bent forward  their hands outstretched. they took a step as if to touch the figure and there was nothing there! the hands met. they clasped warmly in the cold against each other.   my god  what was that   said the stalker.   i dont know   answered the other.   a pierced side!    was it     no. it couldnt be.    well  we worship the same god and    ah  they were seen. there were quick words of command from the trenches  a staccato of rifle-shots  and two bodies lay side by side  hands still clasped  while the snow reddened and reddened beneath them.  and it was christmas eve.     ix  the forgiver of sins      i say unto thee until seventy times seven      ix  the forgiver of sins    a priest  for christs sake  a priest   moaned the man.  a white-faced sister of charity upon whom had developed the appalling task of caring for the long rows of wounded at the dressing station before they were entrained and sent south to the hospital  hovered over the stretcher.   my poor man   she whispered   there is no priest here.    i cant die without confession absolution   was the answer.  a priest  get me a priest.   next to and almost touching the cot on which the speaker writhed in his death agony lay another man apparently in a profound stupor. he wore the uniform of a private soldier and his eyes were bandaged. his face had been torn to pieces by shrapnel  fragments of which had blinded him. at that instant he came out of that stupor. perhaps the familiar words recalled him to himself. he moved his hand slightly. the sister saw his lips tremble. she bent low.   who seeks confession  absolution   he whispered.  i am a priest.    you are wounded  dying  father.    how can i die better than shriving a fellow sinner    that was true. the heroic woman turned to the man who still kept up his monotonous appeal.   the man next to you   she said   dying like you  is a priest.    father   cried the first man with sudden strength.  i must confess before i die.    lift me up   said the priest.  the woman slipped her arm about his shoulders and raised him.   the sister   began the other.   i shall be blind and deaf   said the woman.   speak on   whispered the priest.   i have been a great sinner there isnt time to confess all.    what is heaviest upon your soul  my son     a womans fate.    ah.    there were two who loved her a dozen years ago she preferred me i took her away.    did you marry her     no. and then we quarreled i deserted her. when i came to seek her she was gone young  innocent  penniless  alone in paris i have sought her and never found her.    what is your name   asked the priest suddenly with a fierce note in his quivering voice.   father  can i be forgiven   answered the man giving his name.  the dying soldier stared anxiously up at his bandaged comrade  at the nun who had hid her face behind the shoulder of the priest. he noticed that her body was shaking.   and the womans name    the priest suddenly sat upright. he shook off the sisters restraining hand. he tore the bandage from his own face. he bent over the dying man as he murmured the womans name.   wretch   he cried   look at me.   his face was gashed and cut and torn but something remained by which the other recognized him.   you!  he cried shrinking away.   i loved her  too   said the priest.  i would have married her. when she went away with you holy church received me.    mercy   cried the soldier uplifting his hand.   what mercy did you show her    the priest could not see but he could feel. his hand seized the others throat.   my father   interposed the nun.  he has confessed. god will forgive  even as      who are you   asked the blind priest  fearfully.   the woman!  cried the dying man shaking off the others hand and lifting himself up.  the sight came back to the priest on the instant. the fierce agony that filled his blinded eyes seemed to give place to the gentle touch of a hand upon them. he seemed to hear a mighty word _ephphatha_ that meant  be opened.  light flooded his soul. looking up he was aware of two figures. one of the twain  an old man  gray bearded  was appealing to the other  clad in white raiment and youthful. and the priest suddenly recalled an old and well-known story of a fellow servant who would not have mercy.   father  forgive   whispered the man before him.  as the voice of the dying sinner died away in the silence all was dark again. the priest saw no more  but the horrible pain in his eyes did not return. over his torn features came a look of calm. he lifted his arm. his wavering hand cut the air in the sign of the cross.   _absolvo te_   he murmured as he pitched forward dead upon the breast of the dying.  and the woman tenderly covered them over.        x  the giver of life   he that eateth of this bread shall live forever      x  the giver of life   of the five specters in the boat three were without life. those whose faint breathing indicated that they had not yet reached the point of death were too weak and indifferent to rid the boat of the bodies of the others. ever since the homeward-bound whaler had struck a derelict in a gale of wind north of the falklands and foundered  this little boat  surviving the shipwreck as by a miracle  had drifted on.  for three weeks in vain they had scanned the horizon for a sail. their scanty supply of bread and water had been consumed in ten days. thereafter they had nothing. the baby had died first  next a man whose arm had been broken by a falling spar in the disaster  and then the ships cabin boy. the survivors were a man and a woman. they were both far gone. the woman was plainly dying. the man kept himself up by sheer exercise of will.  their drifting had been northward toward warmer seas. it was winter in their home land and  though they knew it not  christmas day. there the tropic sun blazed overhead from an absolutely cloudless sky. there was no vestige of breeze to stir the canvas of the solitary sail or ripple the glassy surface of the smoothed out ocean. the boat lay still. not even the iron man at the helm could have lifted an oar. it had been dead calm for days. speech there was none except in the gravest necessity. to talk connectedly was impossible.  after scanning the horizon for the thousandth time the mans burning eyes sought those of the woman at his feet. he was astonished to find them open. her mouth was working  her parched lips strove to form words. he dropped the tiller which his hand had grasped mechanically  and which was useless since there was no way on the boat  and bent his head lower. some sudden recrudescence of strength which the dying sometimes receive came to the woman.   death   she whispered.  glad.  she turned her head slightly and saw the form of the child.  the baby and i together.   the man nodded. tenderly he laid his hot wasted hand on the womans fevered brow.   a priest   she said  looking up at him uncomprehendingly.  she was evidently going fast yet she knew what she wanted although she was not conscious that she craved the impossible. it would appear that she had been a good churchwoman. the man could only stare. he was no priest  only a rough sailor.   a priest   said the woman more clearly.  i want a priest the sacrament.  by some nervous convulsive effort she lifted her arms up toward him beseeching  appealing. there was another kind of agony in her voice that had not been present when she had moaned for water in the days before.   the sacrament   she insisted   i die.   the man looked away. hard by the boat where there had been but a waste of sea rose a green island. a stretch of pleasant meadow met his eyes. it was so close to him that if he had leaned over the gunwale of the boat he could have laid his hand on the lush grass. dumbly he wondered where it had been before  how he had come upon it so suddenly  why he had not seen it hours ago.  in front of him were hundreds of people  men  women  and children  plain people in strange simple garb  the like of which he had never seen. in front of these people and with their backs toward him stood a little group of men  in the center a figure in white garments. a lad offered something in a basket.  the man watched  amazed  awe-stricken  yet with a strange peace in his soul. he made no movement to gain the shore. he only looked and looked. the white-robed figure bent over the basket. he lifted from it a crude rough loaf of bread. he raised his eyes to heaven  his lips moved. he broke the bread and gave it.  as the sailor watched the island disappeared as suddenly as it had come. the scene changed. now he looked into a low room  dimly lighted with strange lamps. through an open window he saw the stars. the few men that had stood about the man in the grassy meadow were alone with him in that upper chamber reclining about a table. the man lifted from the board a cup of silver. he blessed it and gave it. the fragrance of wine came to the watcher.  he rubbed his eyes and looked again and before him spread the smooth unbroken surface of the monotonous sea. the womans voice smote his ear again  higher  shriller  with more painful entreaty.   a priest for the love of god the sacrament   she whispered.  the man tore open the last canvas bread-bag. it was tough material but it yielded to his insistence. in the corner there was a single tiny crumb they had overlooked. he lifted it gently with his great hand. he held it up in the air a moment striving to think. he was an english sailor and in his boyhood had been a chorister in a great cathedral. the mighty words came back to him. he bent over the woman.      bread   he whispered.  the body    he shattered the water breaker with his fist. there was a suggestion of moisture on the inside of the staves of the cask. he drew his finger across them and touched it to the womans lips.   water   he said hoarsely.  the blood    the terror  the yearning  disappeared from the womans eyes. she looked at the man sanely  gratefully.   god bless   she faltered and then her lips stiffened.  some tag of quaint old scripture that had impressed him when he first heard it because of its very strangeness  but of which he had never thought in all the years of his rough life since boyhood  came into the mans mind now. he lifted his head as if to see again that figure.   a priest forever   he gasped   after the order of melchis    he did not finish the word. the woman was dead. he knew now for what he had been kept alive. his task had been performed. he bowed his head in his hands and entered into life eternal with the others.  presently a little cloud flecked the sky. out of the south the wind blew softly. the smooth sea rippled blue and white in the gentle breeze. the little boat  cradling its dead  rocked gently as it drifted on.     xi  the stiller of the storm      be of good cheer; it is i; be not afraid      xi  the stiller of the storm    its christmas eve at home   murmured the young lad after he had said his prayers and tumbled into his narrow berth on the great ship.  i suppose theyre trimming the christmas tree now and hanging up the stockings. i wish i were there.   he was very young to serve his country  but not too young according to the standards of mankind to be a midshipman on the great steel monster keeping the leaden deep. it was the first time he had ever been away from home on christmas day  too. the youngsters had all laughed and joked about it in the steerage mess. they had promised themselves some kind of a celebration in the morning  but in his own cot with no one to see  a few tears which he fondly deemed unmanly would come. he had the midnight watch and he knew that he must get some sleep  but it was a long time before he closed his eyes and drifted off to dream of home and his mother.  athwart that dream came a sudden  frightful  heart-stilling roar of destruction; a hideous crash followed  a terrible rending  breaking  smashing  concatenation of noises  succeeded by frightful detonations  as through the gaping hole torn in the great battleship by the deadly torpedo  the water rushed upon the heated boilers  the explosion of which in turn ignited the magazines. by that deadly underwater thrust of the enemy the battleship was reduced in a few moments to a disjointed  disorganized  sinking mass of shapeless  formless  splintered steel.  as the explosions ceased  from every point rose shrieks and groans and cries of men in the death-agony hurled into eternity and torn like the steel. and then the boy heard the surviving officers coolly  resolutely calling the men to their stations.  he had been thrown from his berth by the violence of the explosion. his face was cut and bleeding where he had struck a near-by stanchion. his left arm hung useless. he had lain dazed on the deck for a few moments until he heard the orders of his lieutenant. he was one of the signal midshipmen stationed on the signal bridge. whatever happened that was the place to which to go; he still had a duty to perform.  picking himself up as best he could  he hurried to report to the lieutenant. with such means as were available signals were made. calls for help  oh  never! warnings that the enemys submarines were in the near vicinity and that other ships should keep away.  the captain was on the half wrecked bridge above. the boy noticed how quiet he was  yet his voice rang over the tumult.   steady  men  steady. keep your stations. stand by. be ready.   the old quartermaster whose business it was to tell the hours saluted the captain.   eight bells  sir   he said   midnight. christmas day   he added.   strike them   said the captain.  and  as clear as ever  the four couplets rang out over the chaos and the disaster.   christmas day   the boy murmured.   shes going  men   said the captain  as the cadences died away.  save yourselves. abandon the ship.    christmas morning   said the boy.  i wonder what theyre doing at home.    overboard with you  youngster   said the signal lieutenant;  i wish i had a life-preserver for you  but     merry christmas  sir   said the lad suddenly.   good god!  said the man.  merry christmas! they will think of us at home.   what was left of the ship gave a mighty reel.   quick or shell suck you down   the officer roared  as he fairly flung the boy into the water  and how he hurt that broken arm!  you can swim. strike out. good-by.   the boy had caught a glimpse of the captain standing on the bridge as the wreck went down and then the wild waters closed over his head. it was frightfully cold. a hard gale was blowing. the waves ran terribly high. his left arm was helpless. his head ached fiercely. what was the use  still the boy struck out bravely with his free hand. the instinct of life! it was too dark to see. the sky was covered with drifting clouds. only here and there a little rift of moonlight came through.   christmas morning   he sobbed out as the waves rolled him over.  oh  my god!   he felt himself going down. all at once the waters seemed to grow still. it was suddenly calm. he was no longer cold. he threw his head up for one last look at the sky and life and then he hung  as it were  suspended in some strange way. he saw a figure walking across the smooth of the seas as it had been solid ground. the figure drew nearer  the wind seemed to have died away  but the draperies that shrouded it swung gently as they would while a man walked along. the face he saw dimly  vaguely  but there was light in it somehow. it came slowly nearer.   christmas morning   whispered the boy.  the hand of the figure reached down. it caught the boys right arm. he was lifted up.   home and christmas morning   whispered the boy  closing his eyes.  the moonlight broke through a cloud and fell upon him. a wave rolled over him and the sea was empty as before.                                             he that hath eyes to see  let him see!

company     to  harry s. moore     illustrations    _mrs. gratz watched the thin man search the chicken yard for toober-chlosis bugs_        frontispiece   _he looked like a man who had lost nine hundred dollars  but he did not look like santa claus_      the thin santa claus   mrs. gratz opened her eyes and looked out at the drizzle that made the christmas morning gray. her bed stood against the window  and it was easy for her to look out; all she had to do was to roll over and pull the shade aside. having looked at the weather she rolled again on to the broad flat of her back and made herself comfortable for awhile  for there was no reason why she should get up until she felt like it.   such a christmas!  she said good-naturedly to herself.  i guess such weathers is bad for santy claus. mebby it is because of such weathers he dont come by my house. i dont blame him. so muddy!   she let her eyes close indolently. not yet was she hungry enough to imagine the tempting odour of fried bacon and eggs  and she idly slipped into sleep again. she was in no hurry. she was never in a hurry. what is the use of being in a hurry when you own a good little house and have money in the bank and are a widow  what is the use of being in a hurry  anyway  mrs. gratz was always placid and fat  and she always had been. what is the use of having money in the bank and a good little house if you are not placid and fat  mrs. gratz lay on her back and slept  placidly and fatly  with her mouth open  as if she expected santa claus to pass by and drop a present into it. her dreams were pleasant.  it was no disappointment to mrs. gratz that santa claus had not come to her house. she had not expected him. she did not even believe in him.   yes   she had told mrs. flannery  next door  as she handed a little parcel of toys over the fence for the little flannerys   once i believes in such a santy claus myself  yet. i make me purty good times then. but now im too old. i dont believe in such things. but i make purty good times  still. i have a good little house  and money in the bank    suddenly mrs. gratz closed her mouth and opened her eyes. she smelled imaginary bacon frying. she felt real hunger. she slid out of bed and began to dress herself  and she had just buttoned her red flannel petticoat around her wide waist when she heard a silence  and paused. for a full minute she stood  trying to realize what the silence meant. the english sparrows were chirping as usual and making enough noise  but through their bickerings the silence still annoyed mrs. gratz  and then  quite suddenly again  she knew. her chickens were not making their usual morning racket.   i bet you i know what it is  sure   she said  and continued to dress as placidly as before. when she went down she found that she had won the bet.  a week before two chickens had been stolen from her coop  and she had had a strong padlock put on the chicken house. now the padlock was pried open  and the chicken house was empty  and nine hens and a rooster were gone. mrs. gratz stooped and entered the low gate and surveyed the vacant chicken yard placidly. if they were gone  they were gone.   such a santy claus!  she said good-naturedly.  i dont like such a santy claus taking away and not bringing! purty soon he dont have such a good name any more if he keeps up doing like this. people likes the bringing santy claus. i guess they dont think much of the taking-away business. he gets a bad name quick enough if he does this much.   she turned to bend her head to look into the vacant chicken house and stood still. she put out her foot and touched something her eyes had lighted upon  and the thing moved. it was a purse of worn  black leather  soaked by the drizzle  but still holding the bend that comes to mens purses when worn long in a back trouser pocket. one end of the purse was muddy and pressed deep into the soft soil where a heel had tramped on it. mrs. gratz bent and picked it up.  there was nine hundred dollars in bills in the purse. mrs. gratz stood still while she counted the bills  and as she counted her hands began to tremble  and her knees shook  and she sank on the door-sill of the chicken house and laughed until the tears rolled down her face. occasionally she stopped to wipe her eyes  and the flood of laughter gradually died away into ripples of intermittent giggles that were like sobs after sorrow. mrs. gratz had no great sense of humour  but she could see the fun of finding nine hundred dollars. it was enough to make her laugh  so she laughed.   goodness  such a santy claus!  she exclaimed with a final sigh of pleasure.  such a christmas present from santy claus! no wonder he is so fat yet when he eats ten chickens in one night already. but i dont kick. i like me that santy claus all right. i believes in him purty good after this  i bet!   she went at once to tell mrs. flannery  and mrs. flannery was far more excited about it than mrs. gratz had been. she said it was the hand of retribution paying back the chicken thief  and the hand of justice repaying mrs. gratz for sending toys to the little flannerys  and pure luck giving mrs. gratz what she always got  and a number of other things.   tis the luck of ye  mrs. gratz  maam   she said   and often i do be sayin it is the dutch for luck  meanin no disrespect to ye  and the fatter the luckier  as i often told me old man  rest his soul  and him so thin! and christmas mornin at that  maam  which is nothin at all but th judgment of hivin on th dirty chicken thief  pickin such a day for his thievin  when theres plenty other days in th year for him. keep th money  maam  for t is yours by good rights  and i knew there would some good come till ye th minute ye handed me th prisints for the kids. the good folks sure all gits ther reward in this world  only some dont  an im only sorry mine is a pig instid of chickens  but not wishin ye hadnt th money yersilf  at all  but who would come to steal a pig  and them such loud squealers  and who do you suspicion it was  mrs. gratz  maam     i think mebby i got me a present from santy claus  yes   said mrs. gratz.   and hear th woman!  said mrs. flannery.  do ye hear that now  well  true for ye  maam  and stick to it  for theres no tellin wholl be claimin th money  and if ever santy claus brought a thing to a mortal soul t was him brought ye that. and t was only yesterday ye was sayin ye had no belief in him!    yesterday i dont have no beliefs in him   said mrs. gratz.  to-day i have plenty of beliefs in him. i like him plenty. i dont care if he comes every year.    sure not   said mrs. flannery   and you with th nine hundred dollars in yer pocket. id be glad of the chanst. id believe in him  mesilf  for four hundred and fifty.   that afternoon mrs. flannery  whose excitement had not abated in the least  went over to mrs. gratzs to spend the afternoon talking to her about the money. she felt that it was good to be that near it  at any rate  and when one can make a whole afternoons conversation out of what mrs. casey said to mrs. oreilly about mrs. mcnally  it is a shame to miss a chance to talk about nine hundred dollars. mrs. flannery was rocking violently and talking rapidly  and mrs. gratz was slowly moving her rocker and answering in monosyllables  when some one knocked at the door. mrs. gratz answered the knock.  her visitor was a tall  thin man  and he had a slouch hat  which he held in his hands as he talked. he seemed nervous  and his face wore a worried look extremely worried. he looked like a man who had lost nine hundred dollars  but he did not look like santa claus. he was thinner and not so jolly-looking. at first mrs. gratz had no idea that santa claus was standing before her  for he did not have a sleigh-bell about him  and he had left his red cotton coat with the white batting trimming at home. he stood in the door playing with his hat  unable to speak. he seemed to have some delicacy about beginning.      well  what it is   said mrs. gratz.  her visitor pulled himself together with an effort.   well  maam  ill tell you   he said frankly.  im a chicken buyer. i buy chickens. thats my business dealin in poultry so i came out to-day to buy some chickens     on christmas day   asked mrs. gratz.   well   said the man  moving uneasily from one foot to the other   i did come on christmas day  didnt i  i dont deny that  maam. i did come on christmas day. id like to go out and have a look at your chickens     it aint so usual for buyers to come buying chickens on christmas day  is it   interposed mrs. gratz  good-naturedly.   well  no  it aint  and thats a fact   said the man uneasily.  but i always do. the people i buy chickens for is just as apt to want to eat chicken one day as another day and more so. turkey on christmas day  and chicken the next  for a change thats what they always tell me. so i have to buy chickens every day. i hate to  but i have to  and if i could just go out and look around your chicken yard    it was right there that mrs. gratz had a suspicion that santa claus stood before her.   but i dont sell such a chicken yard  yet   she said. the man wiped his forehead.   sure not   he said nervously.  i was goin to say look around your chicken yard and see the chickens. i cant buy chickens without i see them  can i  some folks might  but i cant with the kind of customers ive got. ive got mighty particular customers  and i pay extra prices so as to get the best for them  and when i go out and look around the chicken yard     how much you pay for such nice  big  fat chickens  mebby   asked mrs. gratz.   well  ill tell you   said the man.  seven cents a pound is regular  aint it  well  i pay twelve. ill give you twelve cents  and pay you right now  and take all the chickens youve got. thats my rule. but  if you want to let me go out and see the chickens first  and pick out the kind my regular customers like  i pay twenty cents a pound. but i wont pay twenty cents without i can see the chickens first.    sure   said mrs. gratz.  i wouldnt do it  too. mebby i go out and bring in a couple such chickens for you to look at  yes     no  dont!  said the man impulsively.  dont do it! it wouldnt be no good. ive got to see the chickens on the hoof  as i might say.    on the hoofs   said mrs. gratz.  such poultry dont have no hoofs.    runnin around   explained the visitor.  runnin around in the coop. i can tell if a chicken has got any disease that my trade wouldnt like  if i see it runnin around in the coop. theres a lot in the way a chicken runs. in the way it hists up its leg  for instance. thats what the trade calls on the hoof. so ill just go out and have a look around the coop     for twenty cents a pound anybody could let buyers see their chickens on the hoof  i guess   said mrs. gratz.   now  thats the way to talk!  exclaimed the man.   only but i aint got any such chickens   said mrs. gratz.  so it aint of use to look how they walk. so good-bye.    now  say   said the man  but mrs. gratz closed the door in his face.   i guess such a santy claus came back yet   said mrs. gratz when she went into the room where mrs. flannery was sitting.  but it aint any use. he dont leave many more such presents.    th impidince of him!  exclaimed mrs. flannery.   for nine hundred dollars i could be impudent  too   said mrs. gratz calmly.  but i dont like such nowadays santy clauses  coming back all the time. once  when i believes in santy clauses  they dont come back so much.   the thin santa claus had not gone far. he had crossed the street and stood gazing at mrs. gratzs door  and now he crossed again and knocked. mrs. gratz arose and went to the door.   i believe he comes back once yet   she said to mrs. flannery  and opened the door. he had  indeed  come back.   now see here   he said briskly   aint your name mrs. gratz  well  i knowed it was  and i knowed you was a widow lady  and thats why i said i was a chicken buyer. i didnt want to frighten you. but i aint no chicken buyer.    no   asked mrs. gratz.   no  i aint. i just said that so i could get a look at your chicken yard. ive got to see it. what i am is chicken-house inspector for the ninth ward  and the mayor sent me up here to inspect your chicken house  and ive got to do it before i go away  or lose my job. ill go right out now  and itll be all over in a minute     i guess it aint some use   said mrs. gratz.  i guess i dont keep any more chickens. they go too easy. yesterday i have plenty  and to-day i havent any.    thats it!  said the thin santa claus.  thats just it! thats the way toober-chlosis bugs act quick like that. theyre a bad epidemic toober-chlosis bugs is. you see how they act yesterday you have chickens  and last night the toober-chlosis bugs gets at them  and this morning theyve eat them all up.    goodness!  exclaimed mrs. gratz without emotion.  with the fedders and the bones  too     sure   said the thin santa claus.  why  them toober-chlosis bugs is perfectly ravenous. once they git started they eat feathers and bones and feet and all a chicken hasnt no chance at all. thats why the mayor sent me up here. he heard all your chickens was gone  and gone quick  and he says to me  toober-chlosis bugs! thats what he says  and he says  you aint doing your duty. you aint inspected mrs. gratzs chicken coop. you go and do it  or youre fired  see  he says that  and he says  you inspect mrs. gratzs coop  and you kill off them bugs before they git into her house and eat her all up bones and all.    and fedders   asked mrs. gratz calmly.   no  he didnt say feathers. this aint nothing to fool about. its serious. so ill go right out and have a look     i guess such bugs aint been in _my_ coop last night   said mrs. gratz carelessly.  i aint afraid of such bugs in winter time.    well  thats where you make your mistake   said the thin santa claus.  winter is just the bad time for them bugs. the more a toober-chlosis bug freezes up the more dangerous it is. in summer they aint so bad theyre soft like and squash up when a chicken gits them  but in winter they freeze up hard and git brittle. then a chicken comes along and grabs one  and it busts into a thousand pieces  and each piece turns into a new toober-chlosis bug and busts into a thousand pieces  and so on  and the chicken gits all filled full of toober-chlosis bugs before it knows it. when a chicken snaps up one toober-chlosis bug it has a million in it inside of half an hour and that chicken dont last long  and when the bugs make for the house whats that on your dress there now    mrs. gratz looked at her arm indifferently.   nothing   she said.   i thought mebby it was a toober-chlosis bug had got on you already   said the thin santa claus.  if it was you would be all eat up inside of half an hour. them bugs is awful rapacious.    yes   inquired mrs. gratz with interest.  such strong bugs  too  is it not     you bet they are strong   began the stranger.   i should think so   interrupted mrs. gratz   to smash up padlocks on such chicken houses. you make me afraid of such bugs. i dont dare let you go out there to get your bones and feet all eat up by them. i guess not!    well  you see you see   said the thin santa claus  puzzled  and then he cheered up.  you see  i aint afraid of them. ive been fumigated against them. fumigated and antiskep antiskepticized. ive been vaccinated against them by the board of health. ill show you the mark on my arm  if you want to see it.    no  dont   said mrs. gratz.  i let you go and look in that chicken coop if you want to  but it aint no use. there aint nothing there.   the thin santa claus paused and looked at mrs. gratz with suspicion.   why  did you find it   he asked.   find what   asked mrs. gratz innocently  and the thin santa claus sighed and walked around to the back of the house. mrs. gratz went with him.  as mrs. gratz watched the thin man search the chicken yard for toober-chlosis bugs all doubt that he was her santa claus left her mind. he made a most minute investigation  but he did it more as a man might search for a lost purse than as a health officer would search for germs. he even got down on his hands and knees and poked under the chicken house with a stick  and  when he had combed the chicken yard thoroughly and had looked all through the chicken house  he even searched the denuded vegetable garden in the back yard  and looked over the fence into mrs. flannerys yard. evidently he was not pleased with his investigation  for he did not even say good-bye to mrs. gratz  but went away looking mad and cross.  when mrs. gratz went into her house she took her seat in her rocking-chair and began rocking herself calmly and slowly.   t was him done it  sure   said mrs. flannery.   i dont like such come-agains  much   said mrs. gratz placidly.  i try me to believe in such a santy claus  but i like not such come-agains. in germany did not santy claus come back so much. i dont like a santy claus should be so anxious. still i believes in him  but  if he has too many such come-agains  i dont believe in him much.    i would be settin th police on him  santy claus or no santy claus   said mrs. flannery vindictively;  th mean chicken thief!    oh   said mrs. gratz easily   i guess i dont care much should a nine-hundred-dollar santy claus steal some chickens. i aint mad.   but she was a little provoked when another knock came at the door a few minutes later  and when  on opening it  she saw the thin santa claus before her again.   so!  she said   santy claus is back yet once!    whats that   asked the man suspiciously.   i say  what it is you want   said mrs. gratz.   oh!  said the man.  well  i aint a-goin to fool with you no longer  mrs. gratz. im a-goin to tell you right out what i am and who i am. im a detective of the police  and im looking up a mighty bad character.    i guess i know right where you find one   said mrs. gratz politely.   now  dont be funny   said the thin santa claus peevishly.  mebby you noticed i didnt say nothing when you spoke about that padlock being busted  mebby you noticed how careful i looked over your chicken coop  and how i looked over the fence into the next yard  well  i wont fool you. i aint no chicken-yard inspector  and i aint no chicken buyer them was just my detective disguises. im out detecting a chicken thief just a plain  ordinary chicken thief and what i come for is clues.    yes   said mrs. gratz.  and what is it  such cloos  i havent any clooses.   the thin santa claus seemed provoked.   now  look here!  he said.  you may think this is funny  but it isnt. i have got to catch that chicken thief or ill lose my job  and i cant catch him unless i have some clues to catch him with. now  didnt you have some chickens stolen last night     chickens   asked mrs. gratz.  no  i didnt have chickens stolen. such toober-chlosis bugs eat them. with fedders  too. and bones. right off the hoofs  aint it a pity    it may have been a blush of shame  but it was more like a flush of anger  that overspread the face of the thin santa claus. he stared hard at the placid german face of mrs. gratz  and decided she was too stupid to mean it that she was not teasing him.   you dont catch on   he said.  you see  there aint any such things as toober-chlosis bugs. i just made that up as a sort of detective disguise. them chickens wasnt eat by no bugs at all they was stole. see  a chicken thief come right into the coop and stole them. do you think any kind of a bug could pry off a padlock    mrs. gratz seemed to let this sink into her mind and to revolve there  and get to feeling at home  before she answered.   no   she said at length   i guess not. but santy claus could do it. such a big  fat man. sure he could do it.    why  you   began the thin man crossly  and then changed his tone.  there aint no such thing as santy claus   he said as one might speak to a child but even a chicken thief would not tell a child such a thing  i hope.   no   queried mrs. gratz sadly.  no santy claus  and i was scared of it  myself  with such toober-chlosis bugs around. he should not to have gone into such a chicken coop with so many bugs busting up all over. he had a right to have fumigated himself  once. and now he aint. hes all eat up  on the hoof  bones  and feet and all. and such a kind man  too.   the thin santa claus frowned. he had half an idea that mrs. gratz was fooling with him  and when he spoke it was crisply.   now  see here   he said   last night somebody broke into your chicken coop and stole all your chickens. i know that. and hes been stealing chickens all around this town  and all around this part of the country  too  and i know that. and this stealing has got to stop. ive got to catch that thief. and to catch him ive got to have a clue. a clue is something he has left around  or dropped  where he was stealing. now  did that chicken thief drop any clues in your chicken yard  thats what i want to know did he drop any clues     mebby  if he dropped some cloos  those toober-chlosis bugs eat them up   suggested mrs. gratz.  they eats bones and fedders; mebby they eats cloos  too.    now  aint that smart   sneered the thin santa claus.  dont you think youre funny  but ill tell you the clue im looking for. did that thief drop a pocketbook  or anything like that     oh  a pocketbook!  said mrs. gratz.  how much should be in such a pocketbook  mebby     nine hundred dollars   said the thin santa claus promptly.   goodness!  exclaimed mrs. gratz.  so much money all in one cloos! come out to the chicken yard once; ill help hunt for cloos  too.   the thin santa claus stood a minute looking doubtfully at mrs. gratz. her face was large and placid and unemotional.   well   he said with a sigh   it aint much use  but ill try it again.   when he had gone  after another close search of the chicken yard and coop  mrs. gratz returned to her friend  mrs. flannery.   purty soon i dont belief any more in santy claus at all   she said.  purty soon i have more beliefs in chicken thiefs than in santy claus. yet a while i beliefs in him  but  one more of those come-agains  and i dont.    hell not be comin back any more   said mrs. flannery positively.  im wonderin he came at all  and the jail so handy. all ye have t do is t call a cop.    sure!  said mrs. gratz.  but it is not nice i should put santy claus in jail. such a liberal santy claus  too.    have it yer own way  maam   said mrs. flannery.  ill own tis some different whin chickens is stole. tis hard to expind th affections on a bunch of chickens  but  if any one was t steal my pig  t jail he would go  santy claus or no santy claus. not but what ye have a kind heart anyway  maam  not wantin t put th poor fellow in jail whin he has already lost nine hundred dollars  which  goodness knows  ye might have t hand back  was th law t take a hand in it.    so!  said mrs. gratz.  such is the law  yet  all right  i dont belief in chicken thiefs  no matter how much he comes again. i stick me to santy claus. always will i belief in santy claus. chicken thiefs gives  and wants to take away again  but santy claus is always giving and never taking.    ye re fergettin th chickens that was took   suggested mrs. flannery.   took   said mrs. gratz.   tooken   mrs. flannery corrected.   tooked   said mrs. gratz.  i beliefs me not in santy claus that way. i beliefs he is a good old man. for givings i beliefs in santy claus  but for takings i beliefs in toober-chlosis bugs.    an th busted padlock  then   asked mrs. flannery.   ach!  exclaimed mrs. gratz.  them reindeers is so frisky  yet. they have a right to kick up and bust it  mebby.   mrs. flannery sighed.   t is a grand thing t have faith  maam   she said.   y-e-s   said mrs. gratz indolently   thats nice. and it is nice to have nine hundred dollars more in the bank  aint it     the end   by the same author   _that pup_  _the great american pie company_  _pigs is pigs_  _mike flannery on duty and off_  _kilo_   little comic masterpieces   pigs is pigs  by
