At least 100 should be good. There should also be at least 10 different authors, but try to keep the texts related (either all on the same topic of from the same branch of literature - something to make classification a bit more difficult than obviously different subjects).\n",

    "Your end result should be a write up of how clustering and modeling compare for classifying your texts. What are the advantages of each? Why would you want to use one over the other?

       "\"chapter i  the coming of joan   along some parts of the coast in south wales the mountains rise abruptly from the shore  with only a narrow shingle between them and the sea.  high above the coast  however  there are warm  sunny little valleys and dells among the hills  where sheep can find pasture and a fold  and here there are many small farmsteads  surrounded by wild rocks and bleak uplands  where the farmer and his family live with their servants  if they happen to have any  as they used to do in old times  sitting in the same kitchen  and taking their meals together as one household.  miss priscilla parry was the last of three leaseholders of one of these little farms. her grandfather had enclosed the meadows and the corn fields from the open mountain  on condition that he should have a lease for three lives from the owner of the land. his own and his son is had been two of the lives  and priscilla is was the third.  the farm was poor  for the land was hard to cultivate. in every field there were places where the rocks pierced through the scanty soil  and stood out  grey and sharp  amid the grass and the ripening corn. the salt laden winds and the fogs from the sea swept over them. miss priscilla spent no money in draining or manuring them  for was not the lease to pass away when she died  and she was nearly sixty years of age already   but the sheep and the cows throve wonderfully on the short  sweet herbage they browsed on the mountains  and her butter and cheese  and the mutton she sold to the butchers  were known through all the country. nobody could produce finer. every one knew she was saving money up in her little mountain farmstead  and the money was being carefully laid by for rhoda parry  the niece she had adopted in her infancy and brought up as her own child   miss priscilla was a spare  hard featured woman  with a weather stained face  and hands as horny as a man is with farm work. twice a week she wore a bonnet and shawl  when she went to market or church. all other times her head was covered by a cotton hood  which could not be damaged by rain  snow  or wind  and in bad weather she often went about her farm with an old sack over her shoulders. her shoes were as thick and as heavily nailed as old nathan is  her head servant  and she strode in and out of her sheds and stables and pigsties as if she had been a man. it was said she could get more work done for smaller wages than any farmer in the country.  there was not a prettier girl in all the parish  which was ten miles across  than rhoda parry  and she was always prettily and daintily dressed. she had her share of the work to do  but it was the easiest and most pleasant. if the weather was fine and clear  she might go to call the cattle home from their cool and breezy pasturage on the mountain side. the cows she had to milk were the gentle ones  that never kicked.  aunt priscilla did the churning of the cream  but rhoda made the butter up into pretty golden pats  and wrapped them in cool  dark green leaves. rhoda tended the little flower patches in the garden  whilst her aunt saw to the vegetables. the light home work  too  was rhoda is  but the rough  laborious scrubbing and washing were done by her aunt and the only little maid they kept.  when rhoda was about eighteen  another niece of priscilla parry is died in london  leaving one little girl quite unprovided for. all the other relatives decided that  as priscilla was a single woman doing well in the world  it was clearly her duty to adopt the child  and without waiting for her consent  or her refusal  which was the more likely  they packed off little joan to her great aunt is farm.  the child was under six years of age  puny and pale and sickly  having lived most of her time in a close back room  up three pairs of stairs  in a london house of business  where her mother had been housekeeper. her only playfellow had been a cat  and the prospect from her window had been the walls of the houses on the opposite side of a narrow court  and a mere streak of sky above them.  miss priscilla did not at all like to have another child thrown upon her. her plans had been laid long ago  and to adopt joan would quite upset them. she intended to make rhoda independent  that she might have no temptation to marry for a home when her aunt died. getting married  to aunt priscilla  usually meant the greatest misfortune that could befall a woman  and to guard rhoda from it was the fixed purpose of her life.  like queen elizabeth  she could not forgive anyone belonging to her  man or woman  who was foolish enough to marry. her old man servant  nathan  had escaped this error  like herself  and both of them had lived free and single and wise  as miss priscilla parry often said  even to their old age. her cherished day dream was that rhoda would follow their example  and dwell with her in tranquillity and peace  until she herself closed her eyes  and fell asleep  in the course of twenty years or more  leaving rhoda a staid  discreet  and unmarried woman of middle age.  here was another child come  a girl too  and if she grew fond of joan she would have the same misfortune to dread for her  and feel the same desire to save her from it. but she was a proud woman  proud of her character and name  and she could not turn the desolate child away. she was in some measure religious too  and if it was god is will  she felt she must take to joan. but aunt priscilla took to joan as a cross.  to rhoda  however  joan was altogether welcome. she had never had a playfellow  and joan was so small and light and delicate that she seemed almost like a plaything  a living doll. the two were never apart. they rambled together about the breezy mountains  catching glimpses of the blue sea here and there  and they ran down the rough  rocky lane to the village on the shore  two miles away  and they kept house on market days  as if it had been a merry sort of game  when aunt priscilla was away. it was a wonderful change to joan from her close  dark little room in london.  the farm house had been built at different times  and though it contained no more than four bedrooms  there were three staircases in it  two of them leading up to single rooms. one of these was set apart for joan and rhoda  where the window looked out upon the small garden and the green mountain slopes  with the sea and the sky around and above them.     the farm kitchen  where they chiefly lived  opened into the fold  round which were built the stables and the cow sheds  with the barn filling up one side of it  between them and the house. in the middle lay a heap of rotting straw  where the pigs burrowed and the fowls scratched diligently for hidden food  and all round it ran a causeway of large round stones  on which the hoofs of the horses rang  and even the soft  slow tread of the cows could be heard. there was a small blacksmith is forge at the end of the fold  for old parry had been something of a smith himself  and miss priscilla could quite well overlook the shoeing of her horses and the mending of her cart wheels.  the house door was always open  and as there was not a morsel of carpet in the place  not even in the parlour  no one was afraid of dirty footsteps. there seemed to be something of busy and cheerful work going on every day  though the place was so far removed from any town or village.     chapter ii  joan is search   miss priscilla parry is head servant  old nathan  took to joan from the first. he was a white headed  strong old man  nearly seventy years of age  but still able to do a fair day is work  or to take the whole management of affairs  if miss priscilla were laid up  which she never had been in all her life. he had lived as a boy with her grandfather  and as a man with her father  and the farm seemed to belong as much to him as to her. like most of the people about  he was no churchman  and being very ready of speech he was a favourite preacher to the little congregations meeting in some of the farm houses scattered about the mountains.  every sunday evening there was a service held in priscilla is kitchen  when twenty or thirty of the neighbours would come in to listen to nathan is sermons. of late years a number of young men  some of whom came long distances  had been in the habit of attending these sunday evening meetings.  old nathan liked this very much  but aunt priscilla is heart was devoured by anxiety. some of the new hearers were neighbours' sons  steady  dull young farmers  too awkward and shame faced to push themselves forward  but there were others  bold young sailors  used to voyaging hither and thither and to making their own way in strange places  who did not hesitate to put themselves in the very front  close by the settle where she sat  and to sing bass to rhoda is treble  and even to find the text for her in the bible. one of them  a notorious young scamp  evan price  was aunt priscilla is greatest plague and aversion  but she never caught a single word or glance from rhoda which could show that the girl encouraged him  or any one among the others  and as long as that was the case she was willing enough for them to look at her treasure  or long for it  but she could not bear the idea of losing it.  to little joan everything was delightful. there had been the hay harvest  and the corn harvest  and the cutting of fern on the mountains for winter fodder  and the threshing of the corn on the barn floor  and the piling up of great heaps of straw in the wide bays on each side of the barn.  and now christmas was coming. joan had never kept christmas  and knew nothing about it. but at aunt priscilla is farm it was a great day  as it always had been since she could remember. every relative who could come to the farm was invited weeks beforehand  and nothing else was talked of but christmas day. the sunday evening before it came old nathan is sermon was all about the shepherds in the field  and how they found the little babe lying in the manger  and he told the story so well that joan did not go to sleep at all  but sat listening to him with her dark eyes wide open.   is it our manger  rhoda   she asked  when they went upstairs to their own little room to bed.  will the babe be lying in our manger to morrow morning     perhaps   answered rhoda   nobody knows whose manger he will come to.    oh  i wish it could be ours   cried joan eagerly.  i wish mary and joseph 'ud bring the little baby here  and the shepherds 'ud come to seek for him. would  not you love it  rhoda     shall we two get up early  very early in the morning  like the shepherds did  and go and look in our manger if he  is there   asked rhoda.   oh  yes  yes   answered joan  almost wild with delight.  oh  rhoda  only suppose the baby should be there    long before old nathan was stirring  or anyone else in the house was awake  rhoda and joan crept quietly down their own little staircase  and after lighting the candle in nathan is great horn lantern  they let down the bar of the house door and stepped out into the fold. it was very dark  but the dim light from the lantern sparkled upon a fine hoar frost  which lay like silver on the causeway and glittered on every straw scattered about the yard. not a sound was to be heard  except a very soft  low moan from the sea  and that they listened for as they stood still on the doorstep. joan is heart was beating fast  and her small fingers clasped rhoda is hand tightly as they stole along the causeway to the cow shed just beyond the barn.  the cow shed was divided into two  and they passed through the outer one  where the cows were lying in their stalls  and turned their large  sleepy eyes upon the two girls  as if to inquire why they were disturbed so early. in the little shed beyond the fodder and the hay were kept  and the stalls were empty. the barn opened into it  and the deep black space under the high roof of the barn served to deepen the delicious awe in joan is little heart. rhoda herself trembled a little with a strange feeling of seeking something which possibly might be found. she had never realised so vividly that the lord jesus christ was indeed born in a stable and cradled in a manger  and she trod softly  with her heart beating  like joan is  faster than usual.  they stood still for a minute on the low door sill  their lantern casting its dim rays into the silent shed. behind them was the deep breathing of the cows  and the slow sound of their munching  and all about them was the sweet  familiar scent of the hay. but this silent  empty spot  half lit up by the lantern  seemed a strange  unfamiliar place they hardly dared to enter. rhoda lingered with a vague awe in her heart  whilst little joan grasped her hand as if in terror.   let us sing 'hark  the herald angels '  whispered rhoda.  very softly  with a timid and tremulous voice  rhoda began the hymn  and little joan took it up in an undertone. they sang the verses through  gathering courage as they did so. then with solemn steps they approached the manger and raised the lantern to look into its cradle lined with hay. it was empty.   i suppose mary is gone somewhere else   said little joan  half grieved   it was  not in her way to come here  p'rhaps  or you and me we'd have been so glad  rhoda     perhaps she  will come next christmas   answered rhoda.  we  will come and look every christmas morning  and sing our hymn  and perhaps we shall find them some time  mary  and joseph  and the babe  wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in the manger. now we will go back  and wake up aunty  and tell her all about it.   aunt priscilla hardly knew what to think of it. rhoda had always been given to  making believe.  she had often played at being david killing goliath with a smooth pebble from the brook  or ruth gleaning in the fields  or the queen of sheba  with a crown of cowslips  visiting king solomon. for the last few years these fancies had left her  but they were all coming back again with little joan. and going to look for the child jesus in the manger  was it right or wrong  she spoke privately to nathan  and the old man smiled  though he shook his white head.   they  will grow older and wiser in time   he said   and sure the lord 'ud never be angered wi' two young creatures seeking after him in any way    but when the next christmas came all was changed at the farm house on the mountain. there had been no preparations made for keeping it as a holiday  and no gathering of kinsfolk was invited by priscilla parry. nathan unbarred the kitchen door  and lighted little joan across the fold  but she went into the stable alone  and stood on the threshold singing the christmas hymn with a sad  pale face that wore a lonely and frightened expression. the manger was empty  as it had been the year before  but the home seemed empty too.  all joan knew of the beginning of this mournful change was  that she awoke one pleasant sunny morning and found rhoda gone.  that day aunt priscilla roamed about the farmstead and the scattered fields her grandfather had enclosed upon the mountain  like one distracted  calling everywhere for rhoda. the farm labourers loitered about the fold and the little blacksmith is shop  whispering mysteriously whenever joan had been within hearing. there had been nobody to keep them to their work  for nathan was away all day  and did not return till the late sunset was past and even the loftiest peak of the highest mountain stood grey and dark against the sky.  nobody had bade joan to go to bed  and she was afraid of her little  lonely  separate room  if rhoda was not coming back to sleep with her. not a single word had aunt priscilla spoken to her all the day  and if the young servant girl had not given her some bread and a bowl of milk she would have been left without food  for aunt priscilla had not eaten a morsel  or sat down in the kitchen  since the early morning.  joan had curled herself up in a corner of the oak settle  which stood as a screen on one side of the corner fireplace  and had fallen fast asleep there  when she was aroused by nathan is voice. he spoke so quietly and sadly that it did not quite awake her  and her drowsy ears took in the sound as if he had been talking to some one a long way off. but suddenly aunt priscilla spoke  in a voice so terrible and loud that she woke up in a fright. her aunt was standing in the middle of the floor  and the light from a candle fell upon her face  weary and grey  and drawn into a frown of stern and passionate anger.   she shall never enter my doors again   she exclaimed   neither she nor her husband  evan price  the worst scamp in the country  i  will never forgive her. deceiving me all these months  let nobody ever name her name to me again  she is dead to me for evermore.    no  no   said old nathan  sorrowfully   do not thee harden thy heart against her  miss priscilla. she  is been deceived as well as us  poor  young  ignorant lass  she does  not know what evan is yet  a handsome young raskill  as all the girls make much of. if she repents  and she will repent  poor creature  thou must pardon her.    never   cried aunt priscilla   not on my death bed     'forgive us our sins as we forgive them as sin against us '  he answered  in a very mournful and solemn voice.   i will never pray that prayer again   she said fiercely.  i have not sinned against the lord as she is sinned against me. i've never brought shame and disgrace on him. the lord may pardon her  but i ca not     hush   exclaimed nathan   hush  god himself is hearkening to us. our sins against him are as if we owed him ten thousand talents  and the sins of our fellow creatures against us are no more than a hundred pence. it is our crucified lord that says it. ah  thou knowest it well. 'o thou wicked servant  said the lord in the parable 'i forgave thee all that debt because thou desiredst me  shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow servant  even as i had pity on thee  and his lord was wroth  and delivered him to the tormentors  till he should pay all that was due unto him. so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you  if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother his trespasses.' it is an awful thing when the heavenly father delivers a soul to the tormentors  may god in his infinite mercy deliver thee  only take heed that thou drive not away his holy spirit from thee    aunt priscilla said no more  but went away upstairs  leaving the kitchen in utter darkness. joan trembled from head to foot as she listened to her heavy tread in the room above. when old nathan struck a light  her white  scared little face was the first thing he saw. he sat down on the settle beside her  and took her tenderly into his arms.   it is a sad day for thee  too  my little lamb   he said   thou  is lost thy playfellow  and there is hard times before thee.    where is rhoda   asked joan  trembling.   she is been tempted away from us   he said sorrowfully   by one as pretends he loves her more than us. but thou must go to bed  my little lass. see  i will carry thee upstairs. i am a poor  rough nurse for thee  but my room is next to thine  on the other side o' the wall  and thee can cry to me i' th' night if thou  is frightened. and to morrow i will knock a hole through the wall  so as thou can hear me speak to thee. but there is no wall between thee and the lord  he is close beside thee  and thou need never be affrighted.   but little joan was frightened  both that night and many another dark hour  when she felt herself alone in the solitary little room. the child is life became very hard and desolate. aunt priscilla took no notice of her beyond providing her with food to eat and clothes to wear. she did not talk to her  and she never took her on her lap or kissed her. sometimes joan would creep timidly to her side and look up into her face  but aunt priscilla never seemed to see her.  there was nothing for the little girl to do but to wander solitarily about the fields or sit up in her lonely room with no one to speak to her for hours together. she was more desolate than she had been in london  for there her mother had sometimes come up to the attic to play with her  or to nurse her in her arms for a few minutes. there was no one to love her now  except old nathan.  there was a still greater change in miss priscilla parry. the neighbours said she was gone out of her mind  and it was true that all her nature seemed turned to hardness and sternness. she was never seen to smile  nor did she speak a word that was not absolutely necessary. she gave up going to church and market  and she refused to see any visitor who came up to the farm.  on sunday evening  when the usual meeting was held in her kitchen  and the curious neighbours came in larger numbers than usual  they no longer saw her in her old place on the settle  where rhoda is pretty face had made so strong a contrast with her aunt is. miss priscilla  after rhoda is foolish flight  always retreated to her bedroom overhead  in which there was a small trap door  made when her mother was bedridden  that she might hear the prayers and the sermon and the singing in the kitchen below. it was some weeks before old nathan  who looked every sunday if the trap door was open  saw that it had been lifted up  and knew his mistress was listening.  when miss priscilla was downstairs about her work it was a sad sight to see her. her grey hair had gone quite white  and her eyes were worn out with weeping. her shoulders were bent as if she was always stooping under a heavy burden  and she seldom lifted her head or looked up from the ground. joan often saw her lips moving  though no sound came through them. everybody except old nathan thought she was mad.     chapter iii  the child in the manger   the long winter evenings were very dreary when the sun set early and the rain and the fogs overspread the mountains  and enshrouded the home with blackness.  aunt priscilla used to retire upstairs  where joan could hear her sobbing often in the darkness  and the two young servants  the maid and the ploughboy  as soon as she was safely out of the way  would slink off out of the kitchen  where their mistress could overhear them.  it was not worth while to light a candle for a little girl like joan  and many a long hour she sat alone in the dark chimney corner with no light save the dull red glimmer of the embers in the grate  and hearing strange  mysterious noises all about her  sounds so low and quiet that they could only be heard when everything else was perfectly still. and going to bed was always a terror to her. the little creature could not put her terror into words  but all day long it was as if some powerful and pitiless enemy was lying in wait to seize her  and as the hour came when all the household went to bed  and she was forced to creep up her separate staircase to her lonely room  the terror reached its utmost height  and she often sprang into bed dressed  and drew the coverings up above her head  lest she should see or hear something more horrible than what she could image to herself.  what joan would have done without nathan no one can tell. during the long winter nights  whenever he was sitting with her by the fireside  he taught her to read  or read aloud to her out of his bible  which was yellow and worn with much turning over of its leaves. he could sing a little still  though now his teeth were gone his voice was weak and quavering  but he made joan sing with him  and took care to choose such hymns as his mistress had been taught when she was a child  knowing well she could not help hearing them through the unceiled rafters overhead. the newer hymns which rhoda had often sung with her young  sweet voice  old nathan never sung  and aunt priscilla  in her dark  desolate room  would sit still and listen  and think of the days when she was herself a child  and go to sleep and dream that she was a child again.  the third christmas eve came  the second since rhoda ran away from her tranquil home and all who loved her truly. joan had grown into a very silent  pale  and sad child  seldom laughing  and with no companion save old nathan and a doll he had bought for her in the market town  where he went every week instead of miss priscilla. she and nathan could not sing   hark  the herald angels   because that was one of rhoda is favourite hymns  but as they sat together on the settle very quiet  for both of them were full of sorrowful thoughts  joan laid her small fingers timidly on the old man is hard and horny hand.   nathan   she said very softly  lest aunt priscilla overhead should hear her   can i go to morrow  like rhoda and me said we would  and look into the manger for the child jesus  i know he ca not be there  because i am a big girl now  but me and rhoda said we'd go every christmas morning very early  and she  will be thinking of it to morrow. i am sure rhoda 'ill remember  and think i am going to look for him.    ay  ay  joan   answered the old man   i would never say nay to anything as is done out o' love. maybe rhoda 'ill be thinking of it  and please god it 'ill do her good. i will be up early i' th' morning and light the lantern  and see thee safe across the fold and hearken to thee singing the 'heral' angels.'   there was neither frost nor snow this christmas. the weather had been as soft and mild as autumn  and there were still some pale monthly roses blooming against the southern walls of the farm house. old nathan lighted joan across the causeway and put the lantern into her hand when they reached the door of the outer cow shed. as she stood alone on the low threshold of the farther shed  and looked up to the black space above her  where the bay of the barn opened into it on her left hand  she felt a little terrified. the light from her dim lantern could not reach the roof  but she could see the piled up straw rising high above her  and the utter blackness beyond it.  her own white  melancholy looking face was lit up by the rays from the perforated top of the lantern  which swung from her hand as she lingered on the door sill gazing forward into the dark shed. the thought of old nathan not far away gave her some courage  and  after a timorous pause of a minute or two  her young  clear  yet tremulous voice began to sing the christmas hymn       hark  the herald angels sing    glory to the new born king    peace on earth and mercy mild    god and sinners reconciled   all the other verses seemed to slip suddenly out of joan is memory. she heard something stirring in the stall before her  the straw rustled softly  and there was a faint  slight sound of a gentle breathing. with her heart beating fast she stole forward on tiptoe to the manger  well lined with hay  and lifted up the lantern. it was no longer empty  there lay a child asleep  a little babe  wrapped in swaddling clothes and cradled in the manger   no doubt was there in joan is little heart  no question as to who the sleeping child could be. all the little learning she had gained died away when she saw the child  she had come to seek the babe whose birth the angels had sung over  and she had found him. without speech or motion  scarcely breathing for very joy  she stood gazing at it. the little head and small face  the tiny hands  filled her soul with awe and tenderness. very timidly she touched the soft cheek with the tip of her finger  the warm  soft cheek  and the baby stirred a little. then joan  hanging the lantern to the rack above the manger  knelt down by its side to watch the quiet slumber of the welcome child   were the angels there  asked joan of herself  unseen and unheard by her  singing glory  and oh  where was mary  his mother  and where could joseph be  she must take care of the sleeping baby till they came back  and surely aunt priscilla would consent to have such guests as these in her house.  but before very long she heard nathan is voice calling her anxiously. he wanted his lantern  and his mind was not quite easy as to whether it was well for joan to keep up a fancy like this. at the sound the baby stirred  and its tiny features grew puckered up  as if it was about to cry. joan sprang up quickly yet quietly  and appeared in the doorway  beckoning to old nathan to keep still.   hush  hush   she cried   he is here sleeping  and you must not wake him. but i do not know where mary is or joseph. there is nobody but the baby. oh  i am so happy  i am so happy     what does joan mean   thought nathan  stepping heavily yet gently on into the inner shed  which he had filled with provender the day before. joan led him to the farther stall  and there  in a warm  soft nest of hay  well wrapped up and sleeping soundly again  lay the baby. the old man stood silently gazing at it till the slow tears trickled down his grey and withered cheeks.   god help us   he sobbed at last   poor little lost babe  come on christmas morning  and where is thy poor  sorrowful mother  what can we do for thee  joan and me  nobody to give thee a welcome but an old man and a little child  but we will love thee for the dear lord is sake as sent thee to us on christmas morning. ay  and  old as i am  i will fight thy battles for thee  poor lamb    very gently he lifted up the tender little creature  and laid it in joan is outstretched arms  which tingled with delight  mingled with fear lest she should loose her hold of it. a flush of colour had come to her pale face  and all the sadness had fled from it  and her eyes were shining with joy. nathan lighted her steps along the stony causeway  which she trod with a thrill of anxious care  lest she might slip and fall with her precious burden. but the house was reached in safety  and the sleeping child had uttered no cry.   lay it warm in thy own bed   said nathan   and wrap the blankets about it  and i will run and fetch nurse williams  that knows how to manage little babes  and keep it still  joan  while i am away  whatever you do  do not let thy aunt hear it till i come back.   how long nathan was away joan could not tell. she knew nothing of time as she knelt by the bedside watching the child sleeping so softly and soundly  its tiny face growing rosy with warmth. but at last her long day dream was broken by the sound of her own name  uttered in so loud and terrible a voice that she felt as if she could not stir hand or foot. it was aunt priscilla is voice  not far away  nay  at the very foot of the steep and narrow staircase leading up to her room. joan is heart seemed to stand still with terror.   joan  bring that child down at once   were the words that rang in her ears   i will not have it one moment under my roof.   joan did not answer or move  except to throw her little arms over the sleeping baby.   no  no   she heard old nathan say   i've lived here in this place all my life  with thy grandfather and father and thee  and i've been true and faithful in my service  and i've grieved over the poor unhappy mother of the little babe as if she'd been my own child  and now  if the baby goes away from out of the house i will go with it. i will stay no longer  not another hour. thou'rt a hard woman  priscilla parry  and god  will show himself hard to thee. with the unmerciful he will show himself unmerciful  and with the froward he will show himself froward. and oh  it is a fearful thing to think of an unmerciful and hard god    joan listened in terror to nathan is strange words  but she did not hear her aunt is voice making any answer. there was utter silence for a long minute or two  followed by the sound of slow and dragging footsteps  which grew fainter and fainter till she could hear them no more. then old nathan came upstairs  and nurse williams  whom he had been to fetch.     chapter iv  lost and found   it was a very happy christmas day for joan  though she never left her little bedroom. her delight was in watching the wonderful christmas child all day  and in helping to nurse him. never had she seen anything so perfectly lovely as his tiny hands and feet  and the little head that nestled down so peacefully on her arm. a good part of the day she was left alone with the baby  for nurse williams was busy about the house  where there was a good deal of stir and excitement. the neighbours were coming in to inquire about the rumours that had reached them  and nathan was away  and miss priscilla had shut herself up in her room  taking no notice whatever of any appeals to her to open the door or to speak.  happy as it was to joan  to old nathan it was the saddest christmas day of his life. he was seeking some trace or tidings of the baby is mother  and his weary feet  made heavy by his heavy heart  trod many a mile that short wintry day in quest of her. it could be no one else but rhoda who had laid the child in the manger. she had never been heard of since aunt priscilla had answered her first and only letter  asking forgiveness  by a bitter  stern  and terrible command that she must never show her face again at home  or dare to ask for any help  whatever misery befell her.  but nathan is search was all in vain. no one had seen her down in the village  or in the scattered dwellings far and wide upon the mountains. but more than one had hinted to him that there were places  not far away  where the cliffs overhung the sea  and as he returned sorrowfully homewards he could hear the sad moaning and sobbing of the sea following him through the stillness of the night air.  but sad as the day was to nathan  it was most miserable of all for aunt priscilla. she had shut out the grey light of the wintry sky from her room  and sat in gloom and cold  doing nothing. but she could not shut out her thoughts and memories  she could not make her heart be still. when she heard through the thin walls the faint little cry of the baby  she fancied it was rhoda is cry when she lay a helpless little creature on her lap. again and again joan is young voice reached her ears  lulling the baby to sleep with the old  familiar words of the christmas hymn      peace on earth and mercy mild    god and sinners reconciled   but there was no peace for her. she paced restlessly up and down her darkened room  repeating to herself hundreds of times   god and sinners reconciled    but she could never be reconciled to god  for she had vowed never to be reconciled to rhoda  who had sinned against her. she had sworn that rhoda should never enter her doors or see her face again. would god let her enter into his house  or behold his face  a silent  secret voice kept whispering in her heart   so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you  if ye from your heart forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.   late at night nathan knocked at her door  but she neither spoke nor opened it.   miss priscilla   he said   i can find no sign of her anywhere. she is gone  poor creature  there is some as fancy she is cast herself away into the sea  and maybe that is true. it is borne in on my heart as that is true  but god knows    aunt priscilla shuddered. she seemed to see in the darkness a slender  girlish figure standing on the edge of one of the cliffs  and casting herself down into the restless tide below. but she did not answer old nathan  and he went away with a very troubled heart.  but in a few days a rumour ran all through the country side that miss priscilla parry is farmstead was haunted. and what spirit could haunt it except rhoda is  the washerwoman  coming to wash at three o'clock in the morning  had seen a dim shape moving slowly in the black shadow of the wall  made visible by a faint light from the setting moon. the ploughboy and nathan  going out early to work  had heard low  rustling footsteps in the cow shed as they opened the door.  nurse williams  who came every night to sleep with the baby  fancied she was awakened by tappings on the lattice panes of the casement. even little joan could hear rhoda is sobs and moans  as she lay awake shivering and trembling in bed  with her arm stretched across the baby to save it from all harm. everybody was certain now that rhoda had thrown herself from the cliffs into the sea  and though her body had been drifted away by the currents  her ghost had come back to haunt the place where she had once been so happy  and where her little baby was living.  aunt priscilla had not left her locked and darkened room since she had entered it on christmas morning. no one dared to tell her directly of rhoda is spirit having come back to trouble and haunt the quiet homestead. but she could hear all that went on in the kitchen below  and in the daytime the neighbours were glad of any excuse to come to the haunted house  though after nightfall no one would venture out into the fold except old nathan. the rough servant girl and the ploughboy had both been to her door  and given her notice that they were going to leave  but she had not asked them for any reason. the last injury rhoda could do to her was to make the house a terror and a talk in the country.  and now  as she sat alone  brooding over the past  with no work filling the hard hands which were used to be so busy  she no longer thought of rhoda with the bitterness of wrath. she remembered what a young girl she was  and how full of fancies  which made it easy for people to deceive her. how terrible must have been the girl is misery before she could drown herself in the sea  and there was no rest for her troubled spirit  even in death  she was not sleeping peacefully in the little churchyard down by the shore  where all their kinsfolk lay within sound of the sea by night and day. there was something awful to aunt priscilla in the thought of rhoda is homeless and restless spirit wandering about the places where she had been an innocent and a happy child   late on new year is eve aunt priscilla drew aside the curtain which had hung across her window since christmas day  and sat in the darkness gazing out into the field. in the house all was as silent as the grave  and out of doors there was the hush of night. a hoar frost had fallen  and gave a glimmer of light  even where the shadows fell  when otherwise it would have been utter blackness. the waning moon hung in the dark sky  above a bank of thick and gloomy clouds. she could hear the distant undertone of the sea  and the murmuring of the many brooks running down the mountain slopes in the winter  for the cold was not yet sharp enough to freeze them.  and she could hear a far off house dog barking  and the nearer clanking of the chains by which the cows were fastened to their mangers  and the loud ticking of the old clock in the kitchen below. it would very soon be midnight. she felt the chill of the keen air  and she shivered as she huddled her shawl closer about her  but it was not the cold that made her lips tremble and her heart throb painfully.  she could fancy  oh  how easily   that she saw rhoda  as she had often seen her  tripping along the causeway  with her bonny  merry face  and her dancing feet. but she knew well it was only a trick her memory was playing. the fold lay all silent and deserted beneath her watchful eyes  with every door safely closed  and the gate at the far end locked. everything was precisely the same as usual.  she was almost dozing in her chair  when all at once she felt her flesh creep  and her heart throb more violently than ever. a black form was stirring  creeping slowly under the walls of the barn  and seemed to be holding itself up by the empty spaces where the bricks had been left out in the building of it. it moved so gradually that it hardly seemed to come closer to the house  and yet it stole on nearer and nearer  a tall  thin  creeping shadow in the midnight gloom. to aunt priscilla it appeared to be hours  though it could only have been some minutes  before the shape reached the house door  and sunk down out of sight on the threshold  under the shadow of the little pent roof over the doorway. she could no longer see it without opening her window and stretching out her head. it was there  just out of sight  and it seemed more terrifying to her than while she could watch its languid and ghostlike progress.  she sat motionless  with no power to move. poor rhoda  poor little child  whom she had loved so fondly  not escaped from her misery  even though she was dead  but wandering  a lost and restless spirit  about her old home  a rush of troubled tenderness flooded aunt priscilla is heart.   god help me   she breathed half aloud.  i never wished her harm like this  i will speak to her  i will call to her. perhaps she is something to say  and ca not rest till she is said it. oh  my poor  poor girl    trembling all over  she unlatched her casement and swung it back on its rusty hinges  which creaked loudly in the utter stillness. the dark heap on the threshold stirred a little  and aunt priscilla called to it in a very low  quivering  and sorrowful voice     rhoda     yes  aunty   came the answer  in a tone so hollow and faint that she could hardly be sure whether it had been spoken  or that she had fancied it.   why do you come to trouble us like this   asked aunt priscilla.   baby is here  and you  and joan   moaned the faint voice again   and there is nowhere else in all the world for me.    is there anything i can do to give you rest   asked aunt priscilla  shivering.   if you'd only forgive me before i die   answered rhoda  lifting up a white  thin face  which could be seen dimly in the gloom.  aunt priscilla sunk down on her knees before the open window. rhoda was not dead  then  it was she herself  not her ghost  that was wandering about the old places  and haunting the home that had once been hers  and which now sheltered her baby. where she had been all the week aunt priscilla did not know  but what was she to do with her now  must she let her die outside her door on this winter is night   as she knelt there in silence she heard the clock strike twelve  and the bells from the little grey belfry of the church on the shore ring cheerily out into the night. two years ago she and her neighbours had watched the old year out in the kitchen below  and she could see  as it were  rhoda is pretty face again  and joan is sleepy eyes  as they stood beside her singing the new year hymn  as soon as the clock had finished striking. the familiar verses of the hymn ran through her mind till she came to the last but one      oh  that each in the day of his coming may say           i have fought my way through    i have finished the work thou didst give me to do    but aunt priscilla felt that she had not finished the work the lord had given her to do for rhoda  she had not even begun what he had given her to do for little joan. if rhoda had sinned against her  surely she had sinned against christ.  with a heavy sob she rose from her knees and went downstairs. the house was empty  except that joan and the baby were sleeping in rhoda is old bedroom  for all the rest had gone to keep the watch night in a chapel two miles or more away. the house door was not fastened  and she had only to lift the latch in order to open it. there was not the slightest sound from the threshold outside where rhoda was crouching  no moaning or sobbing  no movement of any kind. aunt priscilla opened the door very gently and noiselessly.   rhoda   she said  very pitifully.  but the girl did not answer her. she stooped down and raised her up against her shoulder. oh  what a small  light burden she seemed  no heavier than when she was a young child like joan. aunt priscilla lifted her quite easily in her arms  and carried her upstairs and laid her on the bed. then she struck a light  and  shading it with her hand  looked down on rhoda is face  as she had done many a time when she had been a sleeping child  the face was sharp and thin and death like  she looked like one who had perished from hunger and want. was she really dead      little joan was awakened suddenly from a sound sleep  and saw her aunt standing by her bedside  looking to her dazzled eyes a very image of terror. the child uttered a shrill scream  and threw both her arms round the baby  who was lying on a pillow beside her. she thought aunt priscilla had come  knowing that everybody was gone out  to take away the christmas child  she must defend him with all her might.   get up  joan   said aunt priscilla.  rhoda is come home  and you must bring the little baby to her.   she had not seen the child before  and now she stood looking down on the small sleeping face with tears streaming from her eyes  she bent over him and joan  and kissed them both with a strange solemnity  as if she was making a vow to god. then she lighted a candle  and bidding joan come as quickly as she could  she went away again  and in a few minutes joan followed her  carefully carrying the baby in her arms.  there was a pale  sunken face resting on aunt priscilla is pillow  and thin  wasted hands lying on the counterpane. the eyelids were fast closed  and the lips clenched. and yet it was rhoda is face that joan saw  and she called to her loudly and joyfully.   see  rhoda   she cried   i found the little baby in the manger on christmas morning    but rhoda neither saw nor heard. aunt priscilla took the baby from joan and laid it on rhoda is bosom  and placed her hand tenderly on rhoda is head. then it seemed to her that a flicker of life moved over her set and death like face.   sing  joan  sing   said aunt priscilla  earnestly  and joan  with her hands clasped  and her eyes fastened upon rhoda is dear face  sang in a loud  clear voice      hark  the herald angels sing   as she came to the last line   god and sinners reconciled   rhoda is lips moved  as if she was repeating the words to herself  and her white eyelids slowly opened.   not to me   she murmured.   oh  yes  yes  my darling   cried aunt priscilla  falling on her knees   you and me are reconciled  and god 'ill be reconciled to us both. we are both sinners  but he will forgive both you and me.    and my baby   whispered rhoda again  slowly moving one of her wasted arms to put it round him  and gazing mournfully into her aunt is face.   i will take care of him   she answered   god has sent him and joan to me  and i will take care of them for his sake. i took care of you for my own sake  rhoda.   there was a faint smile on rhoda is face  and her eyelids closed again  as if she was too weak to keep them open longer. by and by there came into the quiet room the sound of distant voices  and aunt priscilla crept noiselessly downstairs and across the fold to the gate  to tell nathan what had happened and to bring them all into the house quietly.  that new year is day was as strangely happy a day to joan as the christmas day before it had been. she never left the room where rhoda was lying  for rhoda could not bear her to go out of sight  and only seemed content while she could watch her nursing the baby  in her old fashioned  motherly manner. as joan sat on a low rocking chair  lulling him to sleep with snatches of hymns  and soothing him tenderly if he began to cry  rhoda is eyes shone with a tender light  though the tears dimmed them at times. it was a peaceful  tranquil day  with few words spoken by anyone. aunt priscilla is step had never been so quiet  or her voice so gentle  and she seemed to joan to be quite a different person.  when the short afternoon was over  and nathan is work was done  he came upstairs to visit rhoda. she had been as dear to him as his own child  and as he took her small  withered hand in his  his dim old eyes grew dark with tears.   i saw you every day twice   she said  pausing often for breath   i was hiding in the barn. i hid myself on christmas eve among the straw  like joan and me used to do for fun  and i laid the baby asleep in the manger  for joan to find  and i saw her come  and heard her sing  i was watching her and you. and after that i could not go away  there was nowhere and nobody to go to  and i stayed hiding in the barn. but i was very cold and miserable  i was frightened of dying there in the barn. and in the night i came close to the house  to look for food  and hearken if i could hear the baby. i am not frightened or miserable now     never mind the trouble now  rhoda   said old nathan.  your aunt is forgiven you  and taken you home again  and god  he will forgive us all  and take us home again some day. think o' getting well and strong again  my poor lass.    not me   murmured rhoda  faintly   it is best for me to die  i know  baby  will be happier without me. i could not play with him and make him merry. joan 'ill be as a little mother to him  wo not you  joan  i am going to give him to you for your very own.    for my very own   repeated joan  with wondering  wide open eyes       ay  if aunty will let me   answered rhoda  smiling   she  will love the baby  i know  now she is reconciled to me. nathan  she forgives me  and god forgives me. i am not unhappy any more.    rhoda  my lass   said old nathan   thy aunt 'ill never be happy no more  if thou dies. she is pardoned thee with all her heart  and thou must try to live  and pay her back. tell me where thou  is been all this long while.   for a few minutes rhoda lay silent  with a look of pain on her young  pale face.   i dare  not ever have spoke to aunty   she murmured at last   she is so bitter against marrying. and so i ran away  and we were married at bristol  and then we went to london  and evan deserted me before baby was born. i could not find him again anywhere in london  and it was a dreadful place to stay in without money  and no home. he had not been good to me for a long while before he left me. i've been a very wicked girl  but i've been sorely punished for it  nathan  and i would rather die now  i think  than get well again.    my poor lass   answered old nathan  pitifully   say  'let it be as god pleases.'    let it be as god pleases   repeated rhoda  in her faint  hollow voice.  never could anyone be better nursed than rhoda was nursed. aunt priscilla watched over her day and night  hardly taking rest  and sleeping only a few minutes at a time. no noise was permitted about the farm that could disturb her  only the old  familiar sounds of cattle lowing  and sheep bleating  and the cackling of barn door fowls  which were as soothing as pleasant music to her ears. joan and the baby were always in sight  except when they were sleeping in a little bed on the floor  near at hand  that she might never feel any fear concerning them. every morsel of food she ate was prepared by aunt priscilla herself  who would not trust even nurse williams to do anything for rhoda.  for a few days it was very doubtful whether she could recover from the cold and hunger and weariness she had endured  but by and by there came a slight change  and by the time the spring began there was no longer any fear of her dying.  but rhoda was never the same again. her pretty looks were gone  and so were her merry ways. she was a quiet and grave woman now  often sad. year after year went by  and she heard nothing of the husband who had deserted her. her aunt found her more of a companion than she had ever been before  and they two  with old nathan  gleaned all the brightness of their lives from joan and the baby.  the old farmstead was a happier home for joan than it had ever been for rhoda. she had few indulgences  but she had the baby  the wonderful child whom she had found lying in the manger on christmas day. by and by  as she grew older  she understood rhoda is sorrowful story  and how it was he had been laid there in order that she might find him. but every christmas morning she stole early across the fold  and into the silent and empty shed  as if to seek the christmas child  and when the baby was old enough she took him with her  and told him how she had found him there  and knew he was come to bring    peace on earth and mercy mild    god and sinners reconciled \""

       "\"chapter i the coming of joan along some parts of the coast in south wales the mountains rise abruptly from the shore with only a narrow shingle between them and the sea. high above the coast however there are warm sunny little valleys and dells among the hills where sheep can find pasture and a fold and here there are many small farmsteads surrounded by wild rocks and bleak uplands where the farmer and his family live with their servants if they happen to have any as they used to do in old times sitting in the same kitchen and taking their meals together as one household. miss priscilla parry was the last of three leaseholders of one of these little farms. her grandfather had enclosed the meadows and the corn fields from the open mountain on condition that he should have a lease for three lives from the owner of the land. his own and his son is had been two of the lives and priscilla is was the third. the farm was poor for the land was hard to cultivate. in every field there were places where the rocks pierced through the scanty soil and stood out grey and sharp amid the grass and the ripening corn. the salt laden winds and the fogs from the sea swept over them. miss priscilla spent no money in draining or manuring them for was not the lease to pass away when she died and she was nearly sixty years of age already but the sheep and the cows throve wonderfully on the short sweet herbage they browsed on the mountains and her butter and cheese and the mutton she sold to the butchers were known through all the country. nobody could produce finer. every one knew she was saving money up in her little mountain farmstead and the money was being carefully laid by for rhoda parry the niece she had adopted in her infancy and brought up as her own child miss priscilla was a spare hard featured woman with a weather stained face and hands as horny as a man is with farm work. twice a week she wore a bonnet and shawl when she went to market or church. all other times her head was covered by a cotton hood which could not be damaged by rain snow or wind and in bad weather she often went about her farm with an old sack over her shoulders. her shoes were as thick and as heavily nailed as old nathan is her head servant and she strode in and out of her sheds and stables and pigsties as if she had been a man. it was said she could get more work done for smaller wages than any farmer in the country. there was not a prettier girl in all the parish which was ten miles across than rhoda parry and she was always prettily and daintily dressed. she had her share of the work to do but it was the easiest and most pleasant. if the weather was fine and clear she might go to call the cattle home from their cool and breezy pasturage on the mountain side. the cows she had to milk were the gentle ones that never kicked. aunt priscilla did the churning of the cream but rhoda made the butter up into pretty golden pats and wrapped them in cool dark green leaves. rhoda tended the little flower patches in the garden whilst her aunt saw to the vegetables. the light home work too was rhoda is but the rough laborious scrubbing and washing were done by her aunt and the only little maid they kept. when rhoda was about eighteen another niece of priscilla parry is died in london leaving one little girl quite unprovided for. all the other relatives decided that as priscilla was a single woman doing well in the world it was clearly her duty to adopt the child and without waiting for her consent or her refusal which was the more likely they packed off little joan to her great aunt is farm. the child was under six years of age puny and pale and sickly having lived most of her time in a close back room up three pairs of stairs in a london house of business where her mother had been housekeeper. her only playfellow had been a cat and the prospect from her window had been the walls of the houses on the opposite side of a narrow court and a mere streak of sky above them. miss priscilla did not at all like to have another child thrown upon her. her plans had been laid long ago and to adopt joan would quite upset them. she intended to make rhoda independent that she might have no temptation to marry for a home when her aunt died. getting married to aunt priscilla usually meant the greatest misfortune that could befall a woman and to guard rhoda from it was the fixed purpose of her life. like queen elizabeth she could not forgive anyone belonging to her man or woman who was foolish enough to marry. her old man servant nathan had escaped this error like herself and both of them had lived free and single and wise as miss priscilla parry often said even to their old age. her cherished day dream was that rhoda would follow their example and dwell with her in tranquillity and peace until she herself closed her eyes and fell asleep in the course of twenty years or more leaving rhoda a staid discreet and unmarried woman of middle age. here was another child come a girl too and if she grew fond of joan she would have the same misfortune to dread for her and feel the same desire to save her from it. but she was a proud woman proud of her character and name and she could not turn the desolate child away. she was in some measure religious too and if it was god is will she felt she must take to joan. but aunt priscilla took to joan as a cross. to rhoda however joan was altogether welcome. she had never had a playfellow and joan was so small and light and delicate that she seemed almost like a plaything a living doll. the two were never apart. they rambled together about the breezy mountains catching glimpses of the blue sea here and there and they ran down the rough rocky lane to the village on the shore two miles away and they kept house on market days as if it had been a merry sort of game when aunt priscilla was away. it was a wonderful change to joan from her close dark little room in london. the farm house had been built at different times and though it contained no more than four bedrooms there were three staircases in it two of them leading up to single rooms. one of these was set apart for joan and rhoda where the window looked out upon the small garden and the green mountain slopes with the sea and the sky around and above them. the farm kitchen where they chiefly lived opened into the fold round which were built the stables and the cow sheds with the barn filling up one side of it between them and the house. in the middle lay a heap of rotting straw where the pigs burrowed and the fowls scratched diligently for hidden food and all round it ran a causeway of large round stones on which the hoofs of the horses rang and even the soft slow tread of the cows could be heard. there was a small blacksmith is forge at the end of the fold for old parry had been something of a smith himself and miss priscilla could quite well overlook the shoeing of her horses and the mending of her cart wheels. the house door was always open and as there was not a morsel of carpet in the place not even in the parlour no one was afraid of dirty footsteps. there seemed to be something of busy and cheerful work going on every day though the place was so far removed from any town or village. chapter ii joan is search miss priscilla parry is head servant old nathan took to joan from the first. he was a white headed strong old man nearly seventy years of age but still able to do a fair day is work or to take the whole management of affairs if miss priscilla were laid up which she never had been in all her life. he had lived as a boy with her grandfather and as a man with her father and the farm seemed to belong as much to him as to her. like most of the people about he was no churchman and being very ready of speech he was a favourite preacher to the little congregations meeting in some of the farm houses scattered about the mountains. every sunday evening there was a service held in priscilla is kitchen when twenty or thirty of the neighbours would come in to listen to nathan is sermons. of late years a number of young men some of whom came long distances had been in the habit of attending these sunday evening meetings. old nathan liked this very much but aunt priscilla is heart was devoured by anxiety. some of the new hearers were neighbours' sons steady dull young farmers too awkward and shame faced to push themselves forward but there were others bold young sailors used to voyaging hither and thither and to making their own way in strange places who did not hesitate to put themselves in the very front close by the settle where she sat and to sing bass to rhoda is treble and even to find the text for her in the bible. one of them a notorious young scamp evan price was aunt priscilla is greatest plague and aversion but she never caught a single word or glance from rhoda which could show that the girl encouraged him or any one among the others and as long as that was the case she was willing enough for them to look at her treasure or long for it but she could not bear the idea of losing it. to little joan everything was delightful. there had been the hay harvest and the corn harvest and the cutting of fern on the mountains for winter fodder and the threshing of the corn on the barn floor and the piling up of great heaps of straw in the wide bays on each side of the barn. and now christmas was coming. joan had never kept christmas and knew nothing about it. but at aunt priscilla is farm it was a great day as it always had been since she could remember. every relative who could come to the farm was invited weeks beforehand and nothing else was talked of but christmas day. the sunday evening before it came old nathan is sermon was all about the shepherds in the field and how they found the little babe lying in the manger and he told the story so well that joan did not go to sleep at all but sat listening to him with her dark eyes wide open. is it our manger rhoda she asked when they went upstairs to their own little room to bed. will the babe be lying in our manger to morrow morning perhaps answered rhoda nobody knows whose manger he will come to. oh i wish it could be ours cried joan eagerly. i wish mary and joseph 'ud bring the little baby here and the shepherds 'ud come to seek for him. would not you love it rhoda shall we two get up early very early in the morning like the shepherds did and go and look in our manger if he is there asked rhoda. oh yes yes answered joan almost wild with delight. oh rhoda only suppose the baby should be there long before old nathan was stirring or anyone else in the house was awake rhoda and joan crept quietly down their own little staircase and after lighting the candle in nathan is great horn lantern they let down the bar of the house door and stepped out into the fold. it was very dark but the dim light from the lantern sparkled upon a fine hoar frost which lay like silver on the causeway and glittered on every straw scattered about the yard. not a sound was to be heard except a very soft low moan from the sea and that they listened for as they stood still on the doorstep. joan is heart was beating fast and her small fingers clasped rhoda is hand tightly as they stole along the causeway to the cow shed just beyond the barn. the cow shed was divided into two and they passed through the outer one where the cows were lying in their stalls and turned their large sleepy eyes upon the two girls as if to inquire why they were disturbed so early. in the little shed beyond the fodder and the hay were kept and the stalls were empty. the barn opened into it and the deep black space under the high roof of the barn served to deepen the delicious awe in joan is little heart. rhoda herself trembled a little with a strange feeling of seeking something which possibly might be found. she had never realised so vividly that the lord jesus christ was indeed born in a stable and cradled in a manger and she trod softly with her heart beating like joan is faster than usual. they stood still for a minute on the low door sill their lantern casting its dim rays into the silent shed. behind them was the deep breathing of the cows and the slow sound of their munching and all about them was the sweet familiar scent of the hay. but this silent empty spot half lit up by the lantern seemed a strange unfamiliar place they hardly dared to enter. rhoda lingered with a vague awe in her heart whilst little joan grasped her hand as if in terror. let us sing 'hark the herald angels ' whispered rhoda. very softly with a timid and tremulous voice rhoda began the hymn and little joan took it up in an undertone. they sang the verses through gathering courage as they did so. then with solemn steps they approached the manger and raised the lantern to look into its cradle lined with hay. it was empty. i suppose mary is gone somewhere else said little joan half grieved it was not in her way to come here p'rhaps or you and me we'd have been so glad rhoda perhaps she will come next christmas answered rhoda. we will come and look every christmas morning and sing our hymn and perhaps we shall find them some time mary and joseph and the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in the manger. now we will go back and wake up aunty and tell her all about it. aunt priscilla hardly knew what to think of it. rhoda had always been given to making believe. she had often played at being david killing goliath with a smooth pebble from the brook or ruth gleaning in the fields or the queen of sheba with a crown of cowslips visiting king solomon. for the last few years these fancies had left her but they were all coming back again with little joan. and going to look for the child jesus in the manger was it right or wrong she spoke privately to nathan and the old man smiled though he shook his white head. they will grow older and wiser in time he said and sure the lord 'ud never be angered wi' two young creatures seeking after him in any way but when the next christmas came all was changed at the farm house on the mountain. there had been no preparations made for keeping it as a holiday and no gathering of kinsfolk was invited by priscilla parry. nathan unbarred the kitchen door and lighted little joan across the fold but she went into the stable alone and stood on the threshold singing the christmas hymn with a sad pale face that wore a lonely and frightened expression. the manger was empty as it had been the year before but the home seemed empty too. all joan knew of the beginning of this mournful change was that she awoke one pleasant sunny morning and found rhoda gone. that day aunt priscilla roamed about the farmstead and the scattered fields her grandfather had enclosed upon the mountain like one distracted calling everywhere for rhoda. the farm labourers loitered about the fold and the little blacksmith is shop whispering mysteriously whenever joan had been within hearing. there had been nobody to keep them to their work for nathan was away all day and did not return till the late sunset was past and even the loftiest peak of the highest mountain stood grey and dark against the sky. nobody had bade joan to go to bed and she was afraid of her little lonely separate room if rhoda was not coming back to sleep with her. not a single word had aunt priscilla spoken to her all the day and if the young servant girl had not given her some bread and a bowl of milk she would have been left without food for aunt priscilla had not eaten a morsel or sat down in the kitchen since the early morning. joan had curled herself up in a corner of the oak settle which stood as a screen on one side of the corner fireplace and had fallen fast asleep there when she was aroused by nathan is voice. he spoke so quietly and sadly that it did not quite awake her and her drowsy ears took in the sound as if he had been talking to some one a long way off. but suddenly aunt priscilla spoke in a voice so terrible and loud that she woke up in a fright. her aunt was standing in the middle of the floor and the light from a candle fell upon her face weary and grey and drawn into a frown of stern and passionate anger. she shall never enter my doors again she exclaimed neither she nor her husband evan price the worst scamp in the country i will never forgive her. deceiving me all these months let nobody ever name her name to me again she is dead to me for evermore. no no said old nathan sorrowfully do not thee harden thy heart against her miss priscilla. she is been deceived as well as us poor young ignorant lass she does not know what evan is yet a handsome young raskill as all the girls make much of. if she repents and she will repent poor creature thou must pardon her. never cried aunt priscilla not on my death bed 'forgive us our sins as we forgive them as sin against us ' he answered in a very mournful and solemn voice. i will never pray that prayer again she said fiercely. i have not sinned against the lord as she is sinned against me. i've never brought shame and disgrace on him. the lord may pardon her but i ca not hush exclaimed nathan hush god himself is hearkening to us. our sins against him are as if we owed him ten thousand talents and the sins of our fellow creatures against us are no more than a hundred pence. it is our crucified lord that says it. ah thou knowest it well. 'o thou wicked servant said the lord in the parable 'i forgave thee all that debt because thou desiredst me shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow servant even as i had pity on thee and his lord was wroth and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due unto him. so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother his trespasses.' it is an awful thing when the heavenly father delivers a soul to the tormentors may god in his infinite mercy deliver thee only take heed that thou drive not away his holy spirit from thee aunt priscilla said no more but went away upstairs leaving the kitchen in utter darkness. joan trembled from head to foot as she listened to her heavy tread in the room above. when old nathan struck a light her white scared little face was the first thing he saw. he sat down on the settle beside her and took her tenderly into his arms. it is a sad day for thee too my little lamb he said thou is lost thy playfellow and there is hard times before thee. where is rhoda asked joan trembling. she is been tempted away from us he said sorrowfully by one as pretends he loves her more than us. but thou must go to bed my little lass. see i will carry thee upstairs. i am a poor rough nurse for thee but my room is next to thine on the other side o' the wall and thee can cry to me i' th' night if thou is frightened. and to morrow i will knock a hole through the wall so as thou can hear me speak to thee. but there is no wall between thee and the lord he is close beside thee and thou need never be affrighted. but little joan was frightened both that night and many another dark hour when she felt herself alone in the solitary little room. the child is life became very hard and desolate. aunt priscilla took no notice of her beyond providing her with food to eat and clothes to wear. she did not talk to her and she never took her on her lap or kissed her. sometimes joan would creep timidly to her side and look up into her face but aunt priscilla never seemed to see her. there was nothing for the little girl to do but to wander solitarily about the fields or sit up in her lonely room with no one to speak to her for hours together. she was more desolate than she had been in london for there her mother had sometimes come up to the attic to play with her or to nurse her in her arms for a few minutes. there was no one to love her now except old nathan. there was a still greater change in miss priscilla parry. the neighbours said she was gone out of her mind and it was true that all her nature seemed turned to hardness and sternness. she was never seen to smile nor did she speak a word that was not absolutely necessary. she gave up going to church and market and she refused to see any visitor who came up to the farm. on sunday evening when the usual meeting was held in her kitchen and the curious neighbours came in larger numbers than usual they no longer saw her in her old place on the settle where rhoda is pretty face had made so strong a contrast with her aunt is. miss priscilla after rhoda is foolish flight always retreated to her bedroom overhead in which there was a small trap door made when her mother was bedridden that she might hear the prayers and the sermon and the singing in the kitchen below. it was some weeks before old nathan who looked every sunday if the trap door was open saw that it had been lifted up and knew his mistress was listening. when miss priscilla was downstairs about her work it was a sad sight to see her. her grey hair had gone quite white and her eyes were worn out with weeping. her shoulders were bent as if she was always stooping under a heavy burden and she seldom lifted her head or looked up from the ground. joan often saw her lips moving though no sound came through them. everybody except old nathan thought she was mad. chapter iii the child in the manger the long winter evenings were very dreary when the sun set early and the rain and the fogs overspread the mountains and enshrouded the home with blackness. aunt priscilla used to retire upstairs where joan could hear her sobbing often in the darkness and the two young servants the maid and the ploughboy as soon as she was safely out of the way would slink off out of the kitchen where their mistress could overhear them. it was not worth while to light a candle for a little girl like joan and many a long hour she sat alone in the dark chimney corner with no light save the dull red glimmer of the embers in the grate and hearing strange mysterious noises all about her sounds so low and quiet that they could only be heard when everything else was perfectly still. and going to bed was always a terror to her. the little creature could not put her terror into words but all day long it was as if some powerful and pitiless enemy was lying in wait to seize her and as the hour came when all the household went to bed and she was forced to creep up her separate staircase to her lonely room the terror reached its utmost height and she often sprang into bed dressed and drew the coverings up above her head lest she should see or hear something more horrible than what she could image to herself. what joan would have done without nathan no one can tell. during the long winter nights whenever he was sitting with her by the fireside he taught her to read or read aloud to her out of his bible which was yellow and worn with much turning over of its leaves. he could sing a little still though now his teeth were gone his voice was weak and quavering but he made joan sing with him and took care to choose such hymns as his mistress had been taught when she was a child knowing well she could not help hearing them through the unceiled rafters overhead. the newer hymns which rhoda had often sung with her young sweet voice old nathan never sung and aunt priscilla in her dark desolate room would sit still and listen and think of the days when she was herself a child and go to sleep and dream that she was a child again. the third christmas eve came the second since rhoda ran away from her tranquil home and all who loved her truly. joan had grown into a very silent pale and sad child seldom laughing and with no companion save old nathan and a doll he had bought for her in the market town where he went every week instead of miss priscilla. she and nathan could not sing hark the herald angels because that was one of rhoda is favourite hymns but as they sat together on the settle very quiet for both of them were full of sorrowful thoughts joan laid her small fingers timidly on the old man is hard and horny hand. nathan she said very softly lest aunt priscilla overhead should hear her can i go to morrow like rhoda and me said we would and look into the manger for the child jesus i know he ca not be there because i am a big girl now but me and rhoda said we'd go every christmas morning very early and she will be thinking of it to morrow. i am sure rhoda 'ill remember and think i am going to look for him. ay ay joan answered the old man i would never say nay to anything as is done out o' love. maybe rhoda 'ill be thinking of it and please god it 'ill do her good. i will be up early i' th' morning and light the lantern and see thee safe across the fold and hearken to thee singing the 'heral' angels.' there was neither frost nor snow this christmas. the weather had been as soft and mild as autumn and there were still some pale monthly roses blooming against the southern walls of the farm house. old nathan lighted joan across the causeway and put the lantern into her hand when they reached the door of the outer cow shed. as she stood alone on the low threshold of the farther shed and looked up to the black space above her where the bay of the barn opened into it on her left hand she felt a little terrified. the light from her dim lantern could not reach the roof but she could see the piled up straw rising high above her and the utter blackness beyond it. her own white melancholy looking face was lit up by the rays from the perforated top of the lantern which swung from her hand as she lingered on the door sill gazing forward into the dark shed. the thought of old nathan not far away gave her some courage and after a timorous pause of a minute or two her young clear yet tremulous voice began to sing the christmas hymn hark the herald angels sing glory to the new born king peace on earth and mercy mild god and sinners reconciled all the other verses seemed to slip suddenly out of joan is memory. she heard something stirring in the stall before her the straw rustled softly and there was a faint slight sound of a gentle breathing. with her heart beating fast she stole forward on tiptoe to the manger well lined with hay and lifted up the lantern. it was no longer empty there lay a child asleep a little babe wrapped in swaddling clothes and cradled in the manger no doubt was there in joan is little heart no question as to who the sleeping child could be. all the little learning she had gained died away when she saw the child she had come to seek the babe whose birth the angels had sung over and she had found him. without speech or motion scarcely breathing for very joy she stood gazing at it. the little head and small face the tiny hands filled her soul with awe and tenderness. very timidly she touched the soft cheek with the tip of her finger the warm soft cheek and the baby stirred a little. then joan hanging the lantern to the rack above the manger knelt down by its side to watch the quiet slumber of the welcome child were the angels there asked joan of herself unseen and unheard by her singing glory and oh where was mary his mother and where could joseph be she must take care of the sleeping baby till they came back and surely aunt priscilla would consent to have such guests as these in her house. but before very long she heard nathan is voice calling her anxiously. he wanted his lantern and his mind was not quite easy as to whether it was well for joan to keep up a fancy like this. at the sound the baby stirred and its tiny features grew puckered up as if it was about to cry. joan sprang up quickly yet quietly and appeared in the doorway beckoning to old nathan to keep still. hush hush she cried he is here sleeping and you must not wake him. but i do not know where mary is or joseph. there is nobody but the baby. oh i am so happy i am so happy what does joan mean thought nathan stepping heavily yet gently on into the inner shed which he had filled with provender the day before. joan led him to the farther stall and there in a warm soft nest of hay well wrapped up and sleeping soundly again lay the baby. the old man stood silently gazing at it till the slow tears trickled down his grey and withered cheeks. god help us he sobbed at last poor little lost babe come on christmas morning and where is thy poor sorrowful mother what can we do for thee joan and me nobody to give thee a welcome but an old man and a little child but we will love thee for the dear lord is sake as sent thee to us on christmas morning. ay and old as i am i will fight thy battles for thee poor lamb very gently he lifted up the tender little creature and laid it in joan is outstretched arms which tingled with delight mingled with fear lest she should loose her hold of it. a flush of colour had come to her pale face and all the sadness had fled from it and her eyes were shining with joy. nathan lighted her steps along the stony causeway which she trod with a thrill of anxious care lest she might slip and fall with her precious burden. but the house was reached in safety and the sleeping child had uttered no cry. lay it warm in thy own bed said nathan and wrap the blankets about it and i will run and fetch nurse williams that knows how to manage little babes and keep it still joan while i am away whatever you do do not let thy aunt hear it till i come back. how long nathan was away joan could not tell. she knew nothing of time as she knelt by the bedside watching the child sleeping so softly and soundly its tiny face growing rosy with warmth. but at last her long day dream was broken by the sound of her own name uttered in so loud and terrible a voice that she felt as if she could not stir hand or foot. it was aunt priscilla is voice not far away nay at the very foot of the steep and narrow staircase leading up to her room. joan is heart seemed to stand still with terror. joan bring that child down at once were the words that rang in her ears i will not have it one moment under my roof. joan did not answer or move except to throw her little arms over the sleeping baby. no no she heard old nathan say i've lived here in this place all my life with thy grandfather and father and thee and i've been true and faithful in my service and i've grieved over the poor unhappy mother of the little babe as if she'd been my own child and now if the baby goes away from out of the house i will go with it. i will stay no longer not another hour. thou'rt a hard woman priscilla parry and god will show himself hard to thee. with the unmerciful he will show himself unmerciful and with the froward he will show himself froward. and oh it is a fearful thing to think of an unmerciful and hard god joan listened in terror to nathan is strange words but she did not hear her aunt is voice making any answer. there was utter silence for a long minute or two followed by the sound of slow and dragging footsteps which grew fainter and fainter till she could hear them no more. then old nathan came upstairs and nurse williams whom he had been to fetch. chapter iv lost and found it was a very happy christmas day for joan though she never left her little bedroom. her delight was in watching the wonderful christmas child all day and in helping to nurse him. never had she seen anything so perfectly lovely as his tiny hands and feet and the little head that nestled down so peacefully on her arm. a good part of the day she was left alone with the baby for nurse williams was busy about the house where there was a good deal of stir and excitement. the neighbours were coming in to inquire about the rumours that had reached them and nathan was away and miss priscilla had shut herself up in her room taking no notice whatever of any appeals to her to open the door or to speak. happy as it was to joan to old nathan it was the saddest christmas day of his life. he was seeking some trace or tidings of the baby is mother and his weary feet made heavy by his heavy heart trod many a mile that short wintry day in quest of her. it could be no one else but rhoda who had laid the child in the manger. she had never been heard of since aunt priscilla had answered her first and only letter asking forgiveness by a bitter stern and terrible command that she must never show her face again at home or dare to ask for any help whatever misery befell her. but nathan is search was all in vain. no one had seen her down in the village or in the scattered dwellings far and wide upon the mountains. but more than one had hinted to him that there were places not far away where the cliffs overhung the sea and as he returned sorrowfully homewards he could hear the sad moaning and sobbing of the sea following him through the stillness of the night air. but sad as the day was to nathan it was most miserable of all for aunt priscilla. she had shut out the grey light of the wintry sky from her room and sat in gloom and cold doing nothing. but she could not shut out her thoughts and memories she could not make her heart be still. when she heard through the thin walls the faint little cry of the baby she fancied it was rhoda is cry when she lay a helpless little creature on her lap. again and again joan is young voice reached her ears lulling the baby to sleep with the old familiar words of the christmas hymn peace on earth and mercy mild god and sinners reconciled but there was no peace for her. she paced restlessly up and down her darkened room repeating to herself hundreds of times god and sinners reconciled but she could never be reconciled to god for she had vowed never to be reconciled to rhoda who had sinned against her. she had sworn that rhoda should never enter her doors or see her face again. would god let her enter into his house or behold his face a silent secret voice kept whispering in her heart so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you if ye from your heart forgive not every one his brother their trespasses. late at night nathan knocked at her door but she neither spoke nor opened it. miss priscilla he said i can find no sign of her anywhere. she is gone poor creature there is some as fancy she is cast herself away into the sea and maybe that is true. it is borne in on my heart as that is true but god knows aunt priscilla shuddered. she seemed to see in the darkness a slender girlish figure standing on the edge of one of the cliffs and casting herself down into the restless tide below. but she did not answer old nathan and he went away with a very troubled heart. but in a few days a rumour ran all through the country side that miss priscilla parry is farmstead was haunted. and what spirit could haunt it except rhoda is the washerwoman coming to wash at three o'clock in the morning had seen a dim shape moving slowly in the black shadow of the wall made visible by a faint light from the setting moon. the ploughboy and nathan going out early to work had heard low rustling footsteps in the cow shed as they opened the door. nurse williams who came every night to sleep with the baby fancied she was awakened by tappings on the lattice panes of the casement. even little joan could hear rhoda is sobs and moans as she lay awake shivering and trembling in bed with her arm stretched across the baby to save it from all harm. everybody was certain now that rhoda had thrown herself from the cliffs into the sea and though her body had been drifted away by the currents her ghost had come back to haunt the place where she had once been so happy and where her little baby was living. aunt priscilla had not left her locked and darkened room since she had entered it on christmas morning. no one dared to tell her directly of rhoda is spirit having come back to trouble and haunt the quiet homestead. but she could hear all that went on in the kitchen below and in the daytime the neighbours were glad of any excuse to come to the haunted house though after nightfall no one would venture out into the fold except old nathan. the rough servant girl and the ploughboy had both been to her door and given her notice that they were going to leave but she had not asked them for any reason. the last injury rhoda could do to her was to make the house a terror and a talk in the country. and now as she sat alone brooding over the past with no work filling the hard hands which were used to be so busy she no longer thought of rhoda with the bitterness of wrath. she remembered what a young girl she was and how full of fancies which made it easy for people to deceive her. how terrible must have been the girl is misery before she could drown herself in the sea and there was no rest for her troubled spirit even in death she was not sleeping peacefully in the little churchyard down by the shore where all their kinsfolk lay within sound of the sea by night and day. there was something awful to aunt priscilla in the thought of rhoda is homeless and restless spirit wandering about the places where she had been an innocent and a happy child late on new year is eve aunt priscilla drew aside the curtain which had hung across her window since christmas day and sat in the darkness gazing out into the field. in the house all was as silent as the grave and out of doors there was the hush of night. a hoar frost had fallen and gave a glimmer of light even where the shadows fell when otherwise it would have been utter blackness. the waning moon hung in the dark sky above a bank of thick and gloomy clouds. she could hear the distant undertone of the sea and the murmuring of the many brooks running down the mountain slopes in the winter for the cold was not yet sharp enough to freeze them. and she could hear a far off house dog barking and the nearer clanking of the chains by which the cows were fastened to their mangers and the loud ticking of the old clock in the kitchen below. it would very soon be midnight. she felt the chill of the keen air and she shivered as she huddled her shawl closer about her but it was not the cold that made her lips tremble and her heart throb painfully. she could fancy oh how easily that she saw rhoda as she had often seen her tripping along the causeway with her bonny merry face and her dancing feet. but she knew well it was only a trick her memory was playing. the fold lay all silent and deserted beneath her watchful eyes with every door safely closed and the gate at the far end locked. everything was precisely the same as usual. she was almost dozing in her chair when all at once she felt her flesh creep and her heart throb more violently than ever. a black form was stirring creeping slowly under the walls of the barn and seemed to be holding itself up by the empty spaces where the bricks had been left out in the building of it. it moved so gradually that it hardly seemed to come closer to the house and yet it stole on nearer and nearer a tall thin creeping shadow in the midnight gloom. to aunt priscilla it appeared to be hours though it could only have been some minutes before the shape reached the house door and sunk down out of sight on the threshold under the shadow of the little pent roof over the doorway. she could no longer see it without opening her window and stretching out her head. it was there just out of sight and it seemed more terrifying to her than while she could watch its languid and ghostlike progress. she sat motionless with no power to move. poor rhoda poor little child whom she had loved so fondly not escaped from her misery even though she was dead but wandering a lost and restless spirit about her old home a rush of troubled tenderness flooded aunt priscilla is heart. god help me she breathed half aloud. i never wished her harm like this i will speak to her i will call to her. perhaps she is something to say and ca not rest till she is said it. oh my poor poor girl trembling all over she unlatched her casement and swung it back on its rusty hinges which creaked loudly in the utter stillness. the dark heap on the threshold stirred a little and aunt priscilla called to it in a very low quivering and sorrowful voice rhoda yes aunty came the answer in a tone so hollow and faint that she could hardly be sure whether it had been spoken or that she had fancied it. why do you come to trouble us like this asked aunt priscilla. baby is here and you and joan moaned the faint voice again and there is nowhere else in all the world for me. is there anything i can do to give you rest asked aunt priscilla shivering. if you'd only forgive me before i die answered rhoda lifting up a white thin face which could be seen dimly in the gloom. aunt priscilla sunk down on her knees before the open window. rhoda was not dead then it was she herself not her ghost that was wandering about the old places and haunting the home that had once been hers and which now sheltered her baby. where she had been all the week aunt priscilla did not know but what was she to do with her now must she let her die outside her door on this winter is night as she knelt there in silence she heard the clock strike twelve and the bells from the little grey belfry of the church on the shore ring cheerily out into the night. two years ago she and her neighbours had watched the old year out in the kitchen below and she could see as it were rhoda is pretty face again and joan is sleepy eyes as they stood beside her singing the new year hymn as soon as the clock had finished striking. the familiar verses of the hymn ran through her mind till she came to the last but one oh that each in the day of his coming may say i have fought my way through i have finished the work thou didst give me to do but aunt priscilla felt that she had not finished the work the lord had given her to do for rhoda she had not even begun what he had given her to do for little joan. if rhoda had sinned against her surely she had sinned against christ. with a heavy sob she rose from her knees and went downstairs. the house was empty except that joan and the baby were sleeping in rhoda is old bedroom for all the rest had gone to keep the watch night in a chapel two miles or more away. the house door was not fastened and she had only to lift the latch in order to open it. there was not the slightest sound from the threshold outside where rhoda was crouching no moaning or sobbing no movement of any kind. aunt priscilla opened the door very gently and noiselessly. rhoda she said very pitifully. but the girl did not answer her. she stooped down and raised her up against her shoulder. oh what a small light burden she seemed no heavier than when she was a young child like joan. aunt priscilla lifted her quite easily in her arms and carried her upstairs and laid her on the bed. then she struck a light and shading it with her hand looked down on rhoda is face as she had done many a time when she had been a sleeping child the face was sharp and thin and death like she looked like one who had perished from hunger and want. was she really dead little joan was awakened suddenly from a sound sleep and saw her aunt standing by her bedside looking to her dazzled eyes a very image of terror. the child uttered a shrill scream and threw both her arms round the baby who was lying on a pillow beside her. she thought aunt priscilla had come knowing that everybody was gone out to take away the christmas child she must defend him with all her might. get up joan said aunt priscilla. rhoda is come home and you must bring the little baby to her. she had not seen the child before and now she stood looking down on the small sleeping face with tears streaming from her eyes she bent over him and joan and kissed them both with a strange solemnity as if she was making a vow to god. then she lighted a candle and bidding joan come as quickly as she could she went away again and in a few minutes joan followed her carefully carrying the baby in her arms. there was a pale sunken face resting on aunt priscilla is pillow and thin wasted hands lying on the counterpane. the eyelids were fast closed and the lips clenched. and yet it was rhoda is face that joan saw and she called to her loudly and joyfully. see rhoda she cried i found the little baby in the manger on christmas morning but rhoda neither saw nor heard. aunt priscilla took the baby from joan and laid it on rhoda is bosom and placed her hand tenderly on rhoda is head. then it seemed to her that a flicker of life moved over her set and death like face. sing joan sing said aunt priscilla earnestly and joan with her hands clasped and her eyes fastened upon rhoda is dear face sang in a loud clear voice hark the herald angels sing as she came to the last line god and sinners reconciled rhoda is lips moved as if she was repeating the words to herself and her white eyelids slowly opened. not to me she murmured. oh yes yes my darling cried aunt priscilla falling on her knees you and me are reconciled and god 'ill be reconciled to us both. we are both sinners but he will forgive both you and me. and my baby whispered rhoda again slowly moving one of her wasted arms to put it round him and gazing mournfully into her aunt is face. i will take care of him she answered god has sent him and joan to me and i will take care of them for his sake. i took care of you for my own sake rhoda. there was a faint smile on rhoda is face and her eyelids closed again as if she was too weak to keep them open longer. by and by there came into the quiet room the sound of distant voices and aunt priscilla crept noiselessly downstairs and across the fold to the gate to tell nathan what had happened and to bring them all into the house quietly. that new year is day was as strangely happy a day to joan as the christmas day before it had been. she never left the room where rhoda was lying for rhoda could not bear her to go out of sight and only seemed content while she could watch her nursing the baby in her old fashioned motherly manner. as joan sat on a low rocking chair lulling him to sleep with snatches of hymns and soothing him tenderly if he began to cry rhoda is eyes shone with a tender light though the tears dimmed them at times. it was a peaceful tranquil day with few words spoken by anyone. aunt priscilla is step had never been so quiet or her voice so gentle and she seemed to joan to be quite a different person. when the short afternoon was over and nathan is work was done he came upstairs to visit rhoda. she had been as dear to him as his own child and as he took her small withered hand in his his dim old eyes grew dark with tears. i saw you every day twice she said pausing often for breath i was hiding in the barn. i hid myself on christmas eve among the straw like joan and me used to do for fun and i laid the baby asleep in the manger for joan to find and i saw her come and heard her sing i was watching her and you. and after that i could not go away there was nowhere and nobody to go to and i stayed hiding in the barn. but i was very cold and miserable i was frightened of dying there in the barn. and in the night i came close to the house to look for food and hearken if i could hear the baby. i am not frightened or miserable now never mind the trouble now rhoda said old nathan. your aunt is forgiven you and taken you home again and god he will forgive us all and take us home again some day. think o' getting well and strong again my poor lass. not me murmured rhoda faintly it is best for me to die i know baby will be happier without me. i could not play with him and make him merry. joan 'ill be as a little mother to him wo not you joan i am going to give him to you for your very own. for my very own repeated joan with wondering wide open eyes ay if aunty will let me answered rhoda smiling she will love the baby i know now she is reconciled to me. nathan she forgives me and god forgives me. i am not unhappy any more. rhoda my lass said old nathan thy aunt 'ill never be happy no more if thou dies. she is pardoned thee with all her heart and thou must try to live and pay her back. tell me where thou is been all this long while. for a few minutes rhoda lay silent with a look of pain on her young pale face. i dare not ever have spoke to aunty she murmured at last she is so bitter against marrying. and so i ran away and we were married at bristol and then we went to london and evan deserted me before baby was born. i could not find him again anywhere in london and it was a dreadful place to stay in without money and no home. he had not been good to me for a long while before he left me. i've been a very wicked girl but i've been sorely punished for it nathan and i would rather die now i think than get well again. my poor lass answered old nathan pitifully say 'let it be as god pleases.' let it be as god pleases repeated rhoda in her faint hollow voice. never could anyone be better nursed than rhoda was nursed. aunt priscilla watched over her day and night hardly taking rest and sleeping only a few minutes at a time. no noise was permitted about the farm that could disturb her only the old familiar sounds of cattle lowing and sheep bleating and the cackling of barn door fowls which were as soothing as pleasant music to her ears. joan and the baby were always in sight except when they were sleeping in a little bed on the floor near at hand that she might never feel any fear concerning them. every morsel of food she ate was prepared by aunt priscilla herself who would not trust even nurse williams to do anything for rhoda. for a few days it was very doubtful whether she could recover from the cold and hunger and weariness she had endured but by and by there came a slight change and by the time the spring began there was no longer any fear of her dying. but rhoda was never the same again. her pretty looks were gone and so were her merry ways. she was a quiet and grave woman now often sad. year after year went by and she heard nothing of the husband who had deserted her. her aunt found her more of a companion than she had ever been before and they two with old nathan gleaned all the brightness of their lives from joan and the baby. the old farmstead was a happier home for joan than it had ever been for rhoda. she had few indulgences but she had the baby the wonderful child whom she had found lying in the manger on christmas day. by and by as she grew older she understood rhoda is sorrowful story and how it was he had been laid there in order that she might find him. but every christmas morning she stole early across the fold and into the silent and empty shed as if to seek the christmas child and when the baby was old enough she took him with her and told him how she had found him there and knew he was come to bring peace on earth and mercy mild god and sinners reconciled\""
